	* libsorcery: deprecated dirnames() for get_dirnames() in libmisc
	  cleaned up guess_filename
	* libmisc: adjusted formatting in get_dirnames and get_basenames and made
	  them use the faster internal smgl_dirname and smgl_basename respectively
	* libdispel, libmisc: fixed the only three callers to use get_dirnames

2008-03-25 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: reformatted the files, directories and symlinks functions and
	  made their variable local
	  then did the same for dirnames
	* config: added STAGED_INSTALL default and added DEBUG to the unstaged list
	* libsorcery: rewrote filename_indicates_compression to be less dumb
	* roots: honor environment variables #13263 and improve sourcing #14304

2008-03-24 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: made a few trivial optimisations, making the remaining relevant
	  functions return by reference
	  fixed ENTERED typo in codex_clear_current_spell and two comments
	* grimoire.5, libcodex, libtablet: made BUILD_API=2 the default
	* libmisc: simplified and sped up is_sorcery_var
	* dispel: made downgrading more user friendly #11749; now a list of
	  possible versions is displayed to choose from and the version
	  doesn't need to be specified on the commandline anymore
	* scribe: scribe index now also shows VERSION of grimoires #14233
