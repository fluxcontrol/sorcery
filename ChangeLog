	  show sorcery as alien (bug 8381)
	* uninstall: trivial new uninstall script (bug 8596)

2005-04-15 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libresurrect: mkdir -p $BUILD_DIRECTORY in case we're
	  resurrecting into an install_root (bug 8601)
	* libmisc: only complain about strange /tmp/sorcery dir if it
	  actually exists, it doesnt on new systems or those with tmpfs
	  /tmp after reboot (bug 8599)

2005-04-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  introduced by my change yesterday. The function now uses
	  iterate. Ive made some additional fixups to the code, namely
	  using spaces instead of tabs for indenting and making the query
	  more colorful.

2005-04-04 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtriggers: fix run_script trigger action (bug 8557)

	* libresurrect: fix bug 8441, 'test -f' returns true, by adding
	  quotes around the optional md5sum log it becomes 'test -f ""'
	  which returns false as I had thought 'test -f' would do.
	
2005-03-17 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libresurrect: specifically find spell specific configs file rather
	  than use filter_configs due to our weird environment, also
	  quote a number of filenames that were left unquoted.

	  /dev/null and make them conditional on each other
	* libtablet: preserve the value of TABLET_PATH, whatever it

	  for a resurrect sandbox which obviously wont be self-referential
	  or installed.
	* libsorcery: fix the way spell specific filters are searched for
	* libdispel: fix bug with POST_REMOVE and the tablet, the tablet
	  gets removed before post_remove is called, postpone tablet

2005-03-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: use filter_excluded to incorporate spell level filtering
	* libtablet: add a bunch of file accessor routines, add repair
	  functions to implement tablet versioning, add cleanse functions.
	  improve tablet_find_spell_dir to ignore tablet entries that are
	  broken (bug 8250). Bug 7477 can also be closed now.
	* cleanse: integrate tablet cleanse (bug 7819), add 2>/dev/null to make
	  calls, this surpresses the circular warnings that everyone
	  complains about
	* man8/cleanse.8: update man page with new cleanse --tablet call
	* libdispel: use filter_configs to incorporate spell level
	  filtering, also concludes the fix for bug 7550

2005-03-13 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

2005-02-28 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: move the UPDATE_SCRIPT to a safe location rather than
	  /tmp, update the restore script to use /usr/src instead of /tmp
	  see bug 8263
	* etc/sorcery/config: remove UPDATE_SCRIPT, its defined in sorcery now
	  move RESTORE_SCRIPT to /root since its safer than /tmp and wont

	  handle_checked_config for bug 6725, also fix the parameter listing
	  for install_config_file since it was out of date

	* url_handlers/url_rsync: use progress spinner on things that appear to
	  be initial downloads, it seems that the progress bar can consume a
	  bit too much time just updating if we guess the size incorrectly.

2005-02-28 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: combine number of jobs menu and distcc hosts menu into
	  a single menu, add a field for jobs per host rather than always
	  doing num_hosts+1 for the number of jobs, addresses bug 6432.
	* libgrimoire: enhance make() function to use
	  num_hosts*jobs_per_host+make_njobs for the number of make
	  jobs. Fixes bug 6432
	* libsorcery: make invoke_build_dir to set a USE_DISTCC variable
	  due to the buggy way that spell writers have been told to disable
	  distcc and the way run_compiler works. Provide a new more robust
	  way to disable distcc with DISABLE_DISTCC. Also add a long comment
	  explaining all this stuff for the future explorer.
	* build/run_compiler: respect USE_DISTCC as set from libsorcery
	  instead of just looking at DISTCC_HOSTS
	* compile_config: add a new field for jobs per distcc host

	  upwards to the point of exit despite our best efforts.
	* cleanse: fix output of --nofix_quick to not indicate that
	  cleanse ever had any intention of actually fixing anything

	  from the caller, this is mainly to disable self-conflicts
	  that manifest in resurrect where self-conflicts make no sense
	  (not that they normally make sense either).
	* libresurrect: fix some issues with log pointers in tablet
	  comment off backup/rollback code, im not sure its necessary,
	  will think about it later. Test out conflicts, they work,
	  surprise surprise.
	  
2005-02-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libresurrect: try out handle_changed_config codepath, seems

	  base directory will be there too.
	* libtrack: strip empty lines generated from seperate_state_files
	* cast: fix logic that determines if the spell should be compiled
	  or resurrected.

	  spells, if one of the specified spells is not specified return
	  non-zero

	* libgpg: add header comments to all functions
	* libgpg: add routines for interpriting the return code

	  gaze install's dont flash output and clear it immediatly

2005-02-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

2005-01-17 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  by using ls and wildcard expansion to match any $BUILD variant.
	  This prevents accidental cache clearing if you change the
	  architecture from i686 to i386. Also add the ability to view
	  and edit the removal list "just in case".
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: always specify --build in $OPTS
	  for the default build (bug 7971).

	* etc/sorcery/config: yesterdays change caused the cleanup code

	* cast: be careful what $TMP_DIR is before removing it
	
2005-01-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: make sure $TMP_DIR is always defined since
	  there were some extra scripts that hooked into sorcery and didnt
	  have it defined, then had some errors. Also include a big
	  warning about the dangers of not overriding $TMP_DIR like the
	  other sorcery scripts do.

2005-01-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  backwards compatibility window has closed.

2004-12-31 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix the output of the pass_two message about what spells
	  to cast, SPELLS means just the spells on the command line,
	  SPELLS_TO_CAST is the complete list of spells and their depends
	  (or just the dependents).

2004-12-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libgrimoire: make sure installwatch is OFF for dispel
	  in prepare_install otherwise pesky log files get into the

2004-12-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* volatiles: add /var/state/sorcery, only sorcery state related
	  data goes here and more cognitive checks by cleanse should/will
	  happen on this data rather than the generic spell related checks
	* libtablet: dont make a link to the cache tarball if ARCHIVE is off

2004-12-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  there isnt a -q option to cast anymore

2004-12-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: remove debug output from seperate_state_files that
	  was confusing things in pipes, clean up the file used, this
	  was causing too many duplicates

2004-12-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: fix a call to dialog, bug 7775

2004-12-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  the xinetd.d and init.d directories when sandalle happens to be
	  editing those files :)

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: add a log_adjuster function which handles re-arranging
	  of log files to various formats (relative to /, with TRACK_ROOT
	  as needed, or without STATE_ROOT/INSTALL_ROOT at all)
	* libtrack: rename some functions: archive ->
	  create_cache_archive, md5list -> create_md5list, track ->
	  create_install_log, and fiddle with their parameters so they
	  are more general
	* libdownload: make sure the SOURCE_URL parameters are in the
	  right order, remove some useless pushd's and popd's
	* build_api/common: fix up spell success code to address some
	  problems, use log_adjuster and add to the tablet
	* libtablet: initial cut at the installed grimoire and some support code
	* libsorcery: add a filter_in function that does the inverse
	  of filter, enhance both to work with multiple parameters
	* delve: add a new tool to run indivdual portions of a spell,
	  addresses bugs 1879 and 6281
	* alter: update to use functions which changes names in libtrack
	  (archive -> create_cache_archive, md5list -> create_md5list,
	  track -> create_install_log)
	* state: add a path to the tablet directory
	* config: remove some stuff and add volatiles and configs files
	* volatiles: add, stuff in here is ignored by cleanse (bug 7545)

	* build: ignore the {arch} directory
	* cleanse, alter, cast, gaze, build_api/api1, build_api/api2,

	* libmisc: make mk_tmp_dirs have an optional parameter for the base dir
	* cleanse: fix up the startup code to use mk_tmp_dirs, use the
	  volatiles file and log_adjuster as needed

	  config files specially

2004-12-07 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: Quote $@ for multi-word parameters

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* config: add a default umask of 0022
	* sorcery, libsorcery: Add a menu for setting the umask (bug 7510)
	  this was from a patch written by Jeremy Blosser

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bug 7673 remove some unused cast parameters

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix gaze size to use du instead of ls which has different
	  columns on different boxes. (bug 7750)

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: reload local config after adjusting the
	  arch/optimization settings so they show up in the menu if you
	  run it again
	* archspecs/ia32/c3/*: add some archspecs for c3 (bug 7735)

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix order of parameters in config_query_list to select_list
	* libcast: make query_services check for the xinetd.d and init.d
	  directories before trying to find things in them

2004-12-03 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man5/sorcery_config.5: add STORE_CONF_LOG option.

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: fix restore script to actually work, the previous
	  work was done with poor knowledge of how here documents work,
	  variables are resolved at creation time (which allows the script
	  to actually know where the source might be kept and what the
	  branch is) but the value of the input parameters were being
	  removed (namely $1). Also fixed a similar and latent bug in
	  system-update along the same lines. Bug 7704.

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: add menu item for STORE_CONF_LOG
	* config: add default value for STORE_CONF_LOG (off)
	* libcast: if STORE_CONF_LOG is on, store config.log (if it
	  exists) in the compile log (bug 6776).

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: make select_list have another parameter, which defines
	  the default choice
	* cleanse: update calls to select_list to pass a default (of 0) in
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: make
	  default_post_build/default_post_install call the isntall_initd
	  and install_xinetd functions instead of in run_build/run_install
	* libcast: remove old use_initd and use_xinetd functions for the
	  newer query_services routine which handles both and asks about
	  both installing and enabling/disabling services. It also stores
	  values in persistent variables. Also re-write the install_initd
	  and install_xinetd functions to use the new persistent variables
	  and correctly handle installing/enabling/disabling. Also make xinetd
	  an optional depends if the spell has an xinetd script that
	  is installed. This is bug 1817.
	* libdepends: update run_others to use the query_services function
	  instead of the old use_initd and use_xinetd functions, also load
	  and save persistent variables since query_services now uses them
	* libgrimoire: remove install_initd_confs (yet another layer of useless 
	  indirection)

2004-12-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* x86_32, x86_64: revert -march-k8 back to -march=athlon-xp
	  since gcc 3.4 isnt in the test/stable grimoires yet.

2004-11-28 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: create locks and wait before updating
	* cast: colorize lock messages

2004-11-27 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libhash: Fix quoting

2004-11-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: update mirrors as per bug 7675

2004-11-22 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man/sorcery_config.5: added install_root options

2004-11-23 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix stupid typo in list_add that made persistent
	  variables get added more than once.

2004-11-22 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: saner color choice
	* cast: fix overview at the end to show dependencys dropped
	  by make after errors.

2004-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix mk_tmp_dir weirdness

2004-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

2004-11-21 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/summon.8: updated manpage
	* man8/cast.8: added some missing options

2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: fix bug 7662, scribe wasnt creating a file for the
	  transaction and so the transaction failed thinking there was a
	  write error.

2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: remove a mysterious leftover line, bug 7657
	* url_rsync, libsorcery: apply patches from Eric listed below

2004-11-20 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* url_rsync: Don't depend on a grimoire existing to determine
	  if rsync is available. Bug #7661
	* libsorcery: Now uncompresses Sorcery to $INSTALL_ROOT/usr/src
	  instead of /usr/src. Bug #7659
  
2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: fix bug 7655, scribe add doesnt work without a url (oops)
	* Changelog: fix some entries that used spaces instead of tab

2004-11-19 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/sorcery.8: update
	* man8/scribe.8: update and rewrite
	* man8/dispel.8: updated

2004-11-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: unset CAST_PASS in pass_three and pass_four, if those
	  passes call cast (like from cleanse --fix called from resurrect)
	  then cast gets confused. (bug 7648)
	* libmisc: make config_query_list show the question (bug 7646)

2004-11-18 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/cast.8: rewrite, nice lean page now the config stuff moved

2004-11-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: make default for MD5SUM_DL ask_risky instead of
	  off, some users have had bad downloads and not known it because they
	  didnt know to configure download integrity checking.

2004-11-11 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmedia: dont call goodbye at the end of the sound theme menu
	* sorcery: remove references to $CAST, mainly $CAST --fix because
	  cleanse --fix is to be used

2004-11-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: fix a bunch of stupid problems in update that either came in
	  from a bad merge or were somehow overlooked...

2004-11-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* alter, cast, dispel, invoke, scribbler, scribe, sorcery: fix
	  bug 7524 again, for real this time, I hope...this is getting annoying

2004-11-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: scribe u is scribe update, not unlocalize
	* scribe: fix update to actually unpack and install the tarball

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate: make codex_is_local use local variables
	* libcodex: make codex_find_spell_or_section_by_name not declare
	  variables its returning local

2004-11-04 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* alter, cast, dispel, invoke, scribbler, scribe, sorcery: fixed
	  bug 7524, then environment is conserved when switching from regular
	  user to root

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: forgot to make update code look at $grimoire to
	  determine if the grimoire is local not $i in the case of updating
	  all grimoires (oops).

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api2: fix a backquoting error (oops)

2004-11-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build, install: strip out .arch-id files in case run from arch
	* cabal, libcabal, sorcery, config: move libcabal to its own utility
	  and remove unnecessary references to it in the sorcery script and
	  config file.
	* cabal: use modify_local_config in the one location that modifies
	  the configuration
	* libsorcery, sorcery, libwait_flag: remove libwait_flag as its mostly
	  unused and provides no useful functionality (trying to weed
	  out unnecessary feature creep) bug 7549.
	* url_cvs, url_rsync, url_svn: ensure S_FILE is declared local
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: tabs -> spaces, fix line
	  justification where a poor job was done
	* libcast: move report_install closer to its friends and use
	  let instead of (( ))
	* libtrack: remove syms_not_owned (depreciated and unused)
	* build_api/common, libgrimoire: move real_prepare_install,
	  gather_docs and install_pam_confs out of libgrimoire and into
	  common since they are only called during the build pipeline anyway
	* scribe: rewrite majority of the code. Change parameter parsing
	  to just figure out the subcommand, hand off the rest of the parsing
	  to the subroutines, this makes it so that commands that dont need
	  "from url" dont use it. Stop assuming that grimoires live in
	  CODEX_ROOT. Allow rsyncing and dont needless tar and untar rsync
	  grimoires. Fix bug 7519 scribe add only adds once. Grimoire
	  names now use first match semantics for naming, but can be
	  named by prepending subdirectory names: eg codex/stable.
	* libcodex: hand in hand with scribe updates, update this library
	  in a number of ways. Reorganize the functions. Remove tmpfs
	  functions. Optimize the heck out of as many functions as
	  possible, add a codex_set_current_spell_quick to speed up
	  spell sourcing in situations where it needs to be really fast
	  like scribe --sweep (converting that code is not done yet).
	* libsecurity, gaze: fix function call names based on changes 
	  to libcodex
	* scribe.8: update manual
	
2004-11-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: remove call to install_services
	* libgrimoire: remove install_services (bug 7598)

2004-11-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* mirrors/GNU: fix the mirror listing, bug 7591

2004-10-31 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Minor fixes to bashdocs

2004-10-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sustained: remove rpmunpack, spells that need it now depend on it

2004-10-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: fix use_xinetd to actually work at an acceptable level
	  fix install_xinetd to install enabled and disabled services, and
	  to chmod +x enabled services and chmod -x disabled services. This
	  is a crutch until bug 1817 is fixed.
	* libgrimoire: remove install_xinetd_confs because it was a useless
	  function under install_xinetd, it enables the services and then
	  restarts xinetd which is bad.

2004-10-21 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: deal with the case of load_build_api failing
	* libcast: load_build_api fails if it doesnt recognize the api
	  this is anticipating the day we have api3, and this version
	  of sorcery is old. (bug 7559)
	* build_api/common: silence a popd

2004-10-21 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* scribbler: made su work

2004-10-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: replace spell_okay with spell_ok (oops)

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: Fix bug 7544, remove cast --fix, otherwise known as 459
	  lines of old stale code.
	* cleanse: replace status_okay with spell_okay, and remove some
	  unused functions left over from the --fix rewrite.

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bug 7532, remove lots of inconsistent tabs from
	  cast, except for ones in the cast --fix code

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: fix bug 6423, filter now uses regular expressions
	* excluded, protected: fixed to use regular expressions

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: make list_add really seperate on spaces only, this
	  works around the case where a spell commits the sin of changing
	  IFS on us.

2004-10-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* archspecs/g4+: fix bug 7198, if not using gcc2 use mcpu=7450

2004-10-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* alter, cleanse, dispel, gaze, scribbler, scribe, sorcery, summon:
	  add call to mk_tmp_dirs to set TMP_DIR globally
	* gaze: set TMP_DIR to /tmp just in case for some strange reason it
	  calls something that ends up needing it
	* cast: remove mk_tmp_dirs definition and error handling case
	* libmisc: move mk_tmp_dirs here and improve it to have tons of
	  useless paranoid sanity checking, and to exit for the caller
	  if it fails.

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: change most echo calls to message
	* url_rsync: clean up a few loose ends, try to at least pave
	  the way for a new better rsync module that does both file
	  downloads and source tree downloads

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: set FILE in do_update otherwise funny things happen
	  also remove a duplicate pushd

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bugs 7529 and 7531, check a little more carefully
	  for temp dir creation, and remove silly code from cast --fix.
	  Also make it slightly more obvious that cast --fix is depreciated.

2004-10-16 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* url_rsync: add progress bar for anxious users
	* libmisc: PROGRESS_SPINNER not local so it gets carried on
	  to the next run of the function

2004-10-15 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: apply patch to architecture menu from Benoit Papillault,
	  the menu now has a cancel button and defaults to the previously
	  chosen architecture. Bug 7520.

2004-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: make conflicts work again, bug 7525

2004-10-14 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>

2004-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 7518, handle the case of an empty (but existing)
	  install queue.

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: emergency quickfix for bug 7516, add
	  optimize back to config because more things use it than i thought
	  did (oops!)

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: applied rycee's suggested fix for bug 6303, gaze
	  depends now understands the spell(PROVIDER) syntax and gives a
	  more complete listing of dependent spells.

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: add UPDATEFIX variable
	* sorcery: add item to feature menu for UPDATEFIX
	* libsorcery: only do cleanse --fix basesystem if $UPDATEFIX == "on"

2004-10-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: add flags to set custom CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS
	  values, and a --no-opts flag to disable the use of the
	  optimization flags set through sorcery menus and archspecs
	  (but not the command line)
	* sorcery: Add a menu for setting custom optimization flags,
	  add call to optimize inside optimization menu
	* libsorcery: Make optimize work with features describe above
	* etc/sorcery/config: Remove call to optimize, its called in the
	  build api's and sorcery where needed. Please let me know if its
	  required elsewhere.
	* etc/sorcery/dialogrc: change tag_selected_color to be readable
	  when selected (red on red is bad)
	* man8/cast.8: update with info on new cast options

2004-10-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix bug 7500 ignore score files in /var/games when
	  md5sum checking, and bug 7507, resurrect causes make to behave
	  strangely

2004-10-11 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/alter.8: added warning
	* sustained: added smgl-strip and smgl-prelink:
	  terrible things start happening if these are dispelled.

2004-10-11 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix obvious flaws in upward depends (bug 7496)

2004-10-11 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: fixed Option menu: Color Scheme and distcc have the same
	  letter, bug 7495

2004-10-11 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/alter.8: created, documented seth's alter.

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix buglet where md5sum's are incorrect for a spell file but
	  match elsewhere (say in net-tools) and the spell where we find the
	  files has a - in the name. When this happened cleanse failed to
	  crack the name of the spellname from the md5sum logfile name and thus
	  would report the spell as broken rather than adjusting the
	  logs as needed

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: declare i local in select_provider, bug 7491
	  (thanks sandalle)

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	* libmisc, libdepends:fixed bug 7456
	* libmisc, libapi: modified return value of config_query
	  y -> 0, n -> 1

2004-10-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtriggers, libcast, libsorcery, sorcery: replace cast --fix
	  with cleanse --fix, bug 7397

2004-10-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: unbreak rsync support, bug 7329

2004-10-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  local/media.

	* libmisc: fix bug 7455 (no spaces at the begin of the string
	  after list_add)

2004-10-05 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix bug 7458, incorrect guess for optional_depends
	  provider, also fix a missing local declaration in optional_depends
	  spell

2004-10-04 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel: fix bug 7454, dispel -d was setting the wrong version

2004-10-03 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery_config.5: created a new manpage
	* grimoire.5, gaze.1: added it

2004-09-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: depends is off if provider selected is "none"

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/common: fix trivial bug 7344, switch order CONFIG_LOC
	  and -x ./configure are checked

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: Improve depends/optional_depends querying to
	  look in more places for answers (bug 7382), handle exiled
	  spells more gracefully (7343), as well as the new "default"
	  answers (bug 6295). Option list for providers only shows actual
	  providers, and only once, without the version (bug 6831), list
	  also indicates what spells are installed already, and supports
	  up to 62 providers.
	* libstate: add routines for adding/searching/removing things from the		  default depends/provider files (bug 6295).
	* etc/sorcery/state: add entries for DEFAULT_DEPENDS and
	  DEFAULT_PROVIDERS.
	* sorcery: Add command line interface to interact with default
	  depends/providers (bug 6295).
	* libsorcery: Make get_providers more robust (bug 6831).
	* libapi, libstate: add spell_ok/real_spell_ok function to
	  test for a spell being in any installed state (installed, held,
	  etc.) (bug 7294).

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix reversed logic in cleanse --nofix_quick

2004-09-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix md5sum checking to not accept files that were changed
	  but live in currently installed spells. These files are now removed
	  from the spell's md5sum and install log, and placed in a new
	  "possessed log". This is currently for information only, but
	  may someday be used by sorcery.
	* cleanse: wrap --fix summary messages to 80 characters and re-word
	  the "hopeless" message.
	* etc/sorcery/state: add POSSESSED_LOGS entry.

2004-09-27 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* var/lib/sorcery/modules/libcodex: use parameter expansion instead of
	  dirname and basename in codex_set_current_spell
	* var/lib/sorcery/modules/libmisc: use bash code instead of awk and
	  sed in real_persistent_load and real_list_add

2004-09-25 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* usr/share/man/man5/grimoire.5: general rewrite

	* cleanse: added a progress meter, cosmetic fix

2004-09-13 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* var/lib/sorcery/archspecs/sun4u,sun4u64: Use march=v9 instead of v8

2004-09-10 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* accounts, groups: fixed haldaemon account, added haldaemon group,
	  added messagebus user and group (bugs 7317 and 7338)

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* url_cvs: fix bug 7272, check for the file and fail if it isnt there
	* url_svn: add (slightly modified) handler from bug 7228, this is
	  almost completely untested

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* accounts: add "haldaemon" uid and gid for bug 7317

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate, libapi: fix bug 7295, add spell_held to libapi and
	  fix some comments.
	* libstate: add a function that I'll use later for bug 7277 that
	  was already put into libstate

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: fix bug 7096, stricter name grepping, and remove
	  some mysterious code

	* libhash: Minor fix to avoid trying to run a variable

2004-08-23 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	* usr/sbin/*: Updated and indented command documentation

	  redirected (behavior from api1)

2004-08-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/roots,state, libcrossinstall: Fix bug 4534, you can now
	  specify through the install root menu where cache files get stored.

2004-08-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: add a parameter to view the activity log

2004-08-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: fix resurrect to at least respect INSTALL_ROOT
	  still need to make fixing code respect it.

2004-08-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdownload: Small fix to only look at mirror files that really
	  truely contain mirrors for the url we are expanding

2004-08-12 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* cleanse: added a nice summary at the end (bug #749)

2004-08-11 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: Added some mirrors, thanks Ruskie !

2004-08-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* liburl: Fix a missing call to iterator which in its absence
	  made url_rank do nothing (and I just thought it was faster!).
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: Remove some trailing "/"s that I missed.

2004-08-10 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* cast: added a -V option to override VOYEUR (bug #4623),
	  fixed a typo in process_parameters()

2004-08-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 7166, gaze now handles providers and does not
	  incorrectly list them as orphans. The running time appears to
	  be about 3 times faster too.

2004-08-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery, libsorcery: Fix some menu's to modify different local
	  config files now that we've split the config files up. This fixes
	  the problem of not using the selected mirror.

2004-08-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: If after finishing dependency resolution there are no spells
	  to cast (e.g. they were all z-rejected and the user rejected them)
	  print a message and exit 1.
	* libdepends: Add spell to the cannot cast hash when it fails
	  somewhere in dependency resolution.

2004-08-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 5525, gaze compile now supports an optional version
	  parameter.

2004-08-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel, libdispel: Move numerous dispel functions into a library
	* dispel: Fix numerous obvious flaws in the downgrade function
	* dispel: Non-zero exit status on failure.
	* build_api/api2: turn on installwatch at INSTALL, not BUILD
	* cast, build_api/common, libgrimoire, libinitd, libmisc, libcodex,
	  libtrack, scribe, dispel, libdispel, alter: adjust INSTALL_ROOT code
	  to new model.
	* /etc/sorcery/config, state, media, url, roots: split configuration
	  into more files to be more confusing.
	* libgraph: delete
	* cast: remove unused current_sources function (was used before
	  libdownload re-write)
	* summon, sorcery, config: remove xdelta code
	* libsorcery: remove dl_source, get as they've been depreciated also
	  remove testpack which is only called by get and no one missed it.
	* scribe: update to use download_files instead of url_download, since
	  download_files is the prefered frontend for all downloading.
	* libdepends: fiddle with private_run_depends error handling
	* libgrimoire: format warn_rejected and ask_continue_with_rejected
	  and remove useless cats and message calls in favor of a few,
	  properly quoted message calls.
	* libgrimoire: ask_continue_with_rejected remove poor attempt at
	  dealing with the choice to not continue. Instead return 1 like
	  a well behaved function and dont mess with libdepends.
	* libdownload: beta mirror expanding code, as requested by ruskie
	* liburl, url_handlers/*: take advantage of parallelism when
	  netselecting if possible. This is a necessary compliment to the
	  url expanding code in libdownload, which may generate over 200 urls.
	* /etc/sorcery/mirrors/*: remove trailing / from some mirror names
	* install: now takes an optional parameter as to where it should
	  install to.
	* /etc/sorcery/update/...: remove, sorcery is not a spell
	* libmisc: fix progress spinner for bash 3.0
	* libstate: fix obviously broken remove_spell function
	* sorcery, libcrossinstall: Add a new and simple menu for
	  selecting of install/track/state root.
	* libcrossinstall: Remove invoke_cross_environment since we no longer
	  copy everything all over the place for no apparent reason. Rename
	  and modify the routine to install sorcery somewhere else, instead
	  use the install script included with the sorcery distribution.

2004-08-06 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdownload: fixed in order to make it work again (bug 7214), some 
	  small indenting too

2004-08-05 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: Fix for displaying some sorcery text files
	* liblock: Have liblock notice when disks get full and commits fail
	* cleanse: Make cleanse know about provider switching

2004-08-04 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: add redirection of stderr back to pass_three's summon
	  call, otherwise download progress from wget is not logged.
	  Will fix the url handlers later.
	* libdownload: pushd/popd to /tmp for downloading until
	  the url handlers can figure out where to download things

2004-08-03 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* build_api/api1: move the logging to around the build so that 
	  custom builds get logged too.

2004-08-02 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* build_api/{api1,api2,common}, alter, libsorcery, libcast:
	  use process substitution instead of named fifo for compile logging.
	* build_api/{api2,common}: make the config_loc function run outside of
	  the compile log pipeline.
	* archspecs/amd64/x86_{32,64}: -march=k8 instead of xp

2004-08-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: fix enhancement to not
	  forget BUILD/INSTALL failures (oops)

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdownload: check for pon before using it (bug 7196)

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* cast, api1, api2: removed 2>&1 pipe redirection to make SUPER_DEBUG
	  work again

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libaccount: Improved create_account to use parameter instedad of
	  $SECONDARY_GIDS (bug 7190)
	* libaccount: indented function create_account
	* libaccount: added function sanity_checks to prevend ID clashing

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libcast: `ls | grep -v` -> `find ...`
	* libcast: fixed if .. then .. else, initd scripts should be installed
	  without warning now
	* libcast: fixed debugging calls referring to wrong fucntion

2004-07-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: fix yesterdays enhancement to not
	  overwrite the compile log (oops)

2004-07-28 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: Add a timestamp for when
	  building/installing completes (bug 7136).

2004-07-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* url_http: Remove useless eval from url_http_call_wget
	
2004-07-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: Move clean_logs into cleanse as a --log option, bug 7171

2004-07-23 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* url_cvs: made it work with both cvs and gcvs (bug #7107)

2004-07-22 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libmisc: fix for list_remove, thanks Richard !
	* libmisc: fix for config_query_option to work for cast -r, and also
	  modified it's output to show [y|n] instead of selected option

2004-07-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: Incorporate the --fix rewrite. Most of this work
	  as done by Paul. I just tied things together :) Also changed
	  indentation to two spaces because I felt like it.
	  These changes should also take care of the last of the "filenames
	  with spaces" problems.

2004-07-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdownload: make FALL_BACKS url list local, this caused a rather
	  annoying problem where SOURCE downloads from fallback, then SOURCE2
	  also needs to download from fallback, but ends up re-downloading
	  SOURCE. The variable should have been set to local. Thanks alley_cat!

2004-07-13 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* libcast: default non-essential init scripts to not be enabled by
	  default.  They are still installed.

2004-07-10 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* cast, sorcery: run /tmp scripts with bash directly.
	  This enables one to mount -o remount,noexec /tmp or set the
	  noexec option in fstab for /tmp.

2004-07-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: fix tabs in OMIT_IN variable inside parse_iw, this was
	  causing spells which made symlinks to own the files they were
	  symlinking too. In the case of init.d this was /bin/true.
	* protected: add /bin/true

2004-07-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix config_query to really return 0 in all cases

2004-07-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: move declaration of OPTS above where we source SPELL_CONFIG
	  otherwise we lose all changes to the variable from SPELL_CONFIG

2004-06-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel: missed an api update to remove_depends_status
	* libmisc: fix config_get_option, left out $PERSISTENT_VARIABLES
	  to the real_list_find call (doh! thanks alley_cat)

2004-06-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libapi: fix debug calls to call debug properly
	* summon, libsummon: split summon code into a library so
	  cast can download things directly rather than calling summon
	* install: install out of a svn sandbox without copying .svn files
	* build: WIP build script for rolling a sorcery release tarball
	* cast: remove some unused functions, better tmp file directory support
	  cleanup at the right point, remove TEMPORARY HACK. 
	  Add an experimental optional rule to the makefile in order to
	  get rid of the make dependency dropping and bailing out issue
	* libcast, cast: individual spell download logs (rather than
	  dumping the entire log over and over again)
	* build_api/common, cast: move some code in cast_spell to the build_api
	* libdepends: add a big demystifying comment and re-arrange some
	  functions to hopefully be in a more logical arrangement (to
	  me at least). Change the algorithm used to not re-evaluate a spell.
	* cast, libdepends: add flag to recast spells that are depended on
	  and already installed, but not specifed on the command line.
	* libstate, libdepends, sorcery/config: don't commit depends
	  until cast actually succeeds, change libstate calls to require
	  a depends file to look at rather than assumming DEPENDS_STATUS,
	  add config file variables for uncommitted and abandoned depends
	* libhash: add hash_append and hash_debug_dump functions

2004-06-24 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* sorcery:optimization_menu():
	  Added prelink compile-time menu option for alter
	  Sorted compile-time options alphabetically
	  Add what flags are added to HELP
	  Reworded HELPs to fit 80 columns
	* libsorcery:optimize(): unset alphabetically ;)
	  Add COMBRELOC and PRELINK to be unset
	  Add prelink to PARAM case statement, sort alphabetically

2004-06-23 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* alter: modified to respect ARCHIVE=off for undo caches in
	  md5mend.  Now it should allow you to do any alter on systems
	  with almost no disk space needed with ARCHIVE=off.

2004-06-21 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* alter: added, need to write man page, but until then, alter -h
	  --help as well as --about
	  changed around the interface a bit and added strip and strip-all.
	  more FAQ entries.  Close to feature complete?

2004-06-19 Jason Flatt <jflatt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: Modified usage text for remove and reindex to reflect actual
	  operation of script.

2004-06-19 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libapi, libmisc: added persistent_clear function which unsets
	  persistent variables.
	* libcodex: persistent variables loaded before DETAILS are destroyed
	  by persistent_clear instead by persistent_save

2004-06-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* libdepends: fix assumption that a depends line would always exist
	  in work_optional_depends_provider which caused /all/ depends entries
	  for the spell in question to be removed (oops, thanks alley_cat).

2004-06-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* libcodex: DETAILS now also uses persistence
	* libmisc: unset all persistent variables and PERSISTENT_VARIABLES on
	  persistent_save

2004-06-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libmisc, libapi: fixed wrong commend about returning values

2004-06-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdepends: PREPARE now also uses persistence

2004-06-17 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix assumption that a depends line would always exist
	  in work_depends_provider which caused /all/ depends entries for
	  the spell in question to be removed (oops, thanks alley_cat).

2004-06-10 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Fix removal count in prune() if there is nothing to remove

2004-06-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* scribe: reindented

2004-05-31 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* liburl, url_handlers: Reworked the way netselect works, not quite
	  ideal yet, but at least it will rank everything. More work later...
	* libdownload, libsorcery: Moved download related code to libdownload
	  and rewrote most of the code such that now there should be a better
	  interface to the download process any of the scripts could use.
	  Also made update_sorcery use this new interface.
	* libcodex: ignore the output from a popd in codex_set_grimoire.
	* summon: Fixed to use new interface and to support printing of
	  source and urls. Also added a "raw" mode to re-read output from
	  print mode. Depreciated xdelta functionality.
	* gaze: Make gaze use some of the same functions that summon's
	  --print feature uses for the "sources" and new "source_urls"
	  option.

	* libsorcery excluded: revert Casey Harkins, blind removal of
	  the "files", "directories" and "symlinks" functions (change 34187).

2004-05-21 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* libcrossinstall: /tmp and /var/tmp given proper permissions, 
	  bug #6891.

2004-05-23 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* config_query_* functions now respects reconfigure option for cast

2004-05-23 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* cosmetic fix for libmisc/config_get_option

2004-05-21 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* archspecs/amd64: added two versions for AMD64 specs, one
	  is for -m64 and one is for 32 bit with -m32, bug #5487.
	* libcrossinstall, sorcery: added menu to libcrossinstall for
	  user menu to set install root as he/she pleases, bug #4933.
	* sorcery: rigorous testing with help from sandall produced
	  a need to reset install_root when turning off cross install.

2004-05-19 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libhash: Applied Afrayedknot's hint on speeding up things,
	  version 2 :)

2004-05-18 Casey Harkins <charkins@pobox.com>
	* libsorcery: modified filter() to accept patterns, bug #6423
	* excluded: added /lib/modules/*/modules.*, bugs #6423, #6331

2004-05-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libhash: reverted for now

2004-05-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libhash: Applied Afrayedknot's hint on speeding up things,
	  which gives us nice -1s per cast

2004-05-17 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* subroutines: added fix from alley_cat to make it "ls"
	  anything independent.
	* libstate: fixed problem with libstate.modify_local_config()
	  not passing more than one arg to be set with variable, thanks
	  to CuZnDragon for pointing out the problem. I am not sure how
	  this came to be... what has changed that might cause this? Or
	  was this around longer and just unnoticed?

2004-05-17 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>

	* libdepends: spelling corrections.

2004-04-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast, libdepends: Fixed the private_compute_installed_depends
	  function. The function was failing to properly create a depends
	  tree, and was taking too long to run. It now correctly builds the
	  dependency tree out of installed spells and, most of the processing
	  is now internal to awk, and thus much faster. One libhash operation
	  per installed spell in contrast to three or more depending on the
	  size, and amount of lint in the depends file.

2004-04-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: add ability to override functions in the build pipeline with

	  Hopefully these efforts will make sorcery calls less of a web
	  structure.

2004-04-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1 build_api/api2: Add return values to run_build_spell 
	  so that the caller can do special stuff this may end up just getting 
	  passed back to the success/fail api specific function instead. Fixes 
	  issues with compile log generation after aborts from bad md5s during 
	  unpack.

2004-04-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* Adding code for build split. Major changes to cast, libsorcery,

	* libcrossinstall: adding /var/spool/mail to list of dirs to be made
	* Scribe,libcodex: make scribe work with INSTALL_ROOT, adding multiple
	  grimoires not working yet, but "CROSS_INSTALL=on scribe add stable"

	  it's command line arguments.

	* Working transaction support added to liblock
	* Added a bit of documentation to libgraph

2002-09-29 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>

2002-09-28 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Duplicate sections are only listed once in sorcery now

2002-09-27 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Bugs 1090 and 81: codex function didn't like different IFS env
	  var. Something to consider: overriding echo with an echo that
	  respects IFS.

2002-09-26 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Bug 871: ask(ignore) for d/l md5sum wasn't acting properly.
	* Bug 698: More sourceforge mirrors

2002-09-26 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Finished addition of run_prepare(), which is run before the
	  DETAILS file during a cast. The file it executes is named
	  PREPARE in the spells directory.
	* Bug #1041: Fixed bug as reported by Jon Svendsen
	  <jon-sven@frisurf.no>, where a function in lib_url was
	  accessing an undefined variable.
	* Bug #1042: Fixed bug as reported by Jon Svendsen
	  <jon-sven@frisurf.no>, a few syntax errors in scribe.

2002-09-20 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Bug #1034: cast -r $SPELL was not asking configure questions.
	  Took out Ryans patch (which switched order of CONFIGURE and
	  DETAILS).

2002-09-18 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Bug #1020: Fixed syntax error in sorcery.restore script. Also
	  added a bit more flexibility to the method in which it restores.

2002-09-16 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Bug #972: Fixed bug where new spells were being added directly to
	  $SPELL_STATUS, instead of $SPELL_STATUS_BACKUP (and then copied
	  over to $SPELL_STATUS).

2002-09-15 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Added "fix" to scribe. Will now help users repair metadata if it's
	  missing. Either during update, or when user types
	  "scribe fix <grimoire>"

2002-09-14 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Fixed Nicks change to the *IFS variables - $TAB_ENTER_IFS should be

2002-09-14 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* updated run_configure to set the $SPELL_DIRECTORY value as
	  needed
	* fixed an annoying grammatical error in cast --fix. "is broke."
	  is now "is broken."

2002-09-12 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Fixed list_install_queue to work right.

	* Bug #962: Applied Casey Harkins patch to fix gather_docs()

2002-09-11 Nick Jennings <njennings@sourcemage.org>
	* Moved function 'list_install_queue' from summon, to libsorcery
	  In order to consolidate code, use of the function now in cast,
	  summon & sorcery scripts.
	* Renamed libsorcery function 'update_installed' to
	  'update_install_queue' to describe it better.
	* If cast is called with a --queue, it will 'list_install_queue'
	  unless the param '-q' (quiet) is used, then it will not.
	* Added use of 'cast -q --queue' to sorcery queue.
	* General code cleanup & verbosity style/cleanup in a few areas.
	* Modified 'summon' to use 'list_install_queue' correctly as well.
	* Set default SORCERY_BRANCH to 'stable'

2002-09-10 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Split the conversion routines out of ./install. Users
	  changing from pre-0.8 will need to run convert /immediately/
	  after installing the new sorcery.. their updates WILL break
	  otherwise (unless sorcery is updated last). A solution is to
	  put an IF in ./install to check for the version of
	  0.1.whatever currently in stable/testing.

2002-09-10 Nick jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Initial checking of re-vamped UID/GID management. Not working.

2002-09-09 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Changed an echo to use "message()" to avoid printing what should be
	  control characters.
	* And now, I'm going to break everything by committing depends
	  changes. Have fun :o)

2002-09-09 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Removed over-verbose DEBUG message for progress_spinner in libmisc.
	* Removed broken version reporting (not needed).

	  meant yes).

	* Added KEYWORD support to gaze search. Spells can
	  now contain KEYWORDS file that will be parsed in
	  a search
	* Added more verbose search results
	* Added gaze search progress spinner

2002-09-06 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Removed two old grimoire vars $GRIMOIRE_DIR and
	  $TRUE_GRIMOIRE. They were screwing up libcodex and
	  causing /var/lib/sorcery/grimore to end up in the codex
	  list. This can't happen, so they are removed.
	* Updated Summon to print help if no params.

2002-09-06 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Formatting DEBUG output to be a little easier to follow. Took out
	  some really spammy DEBUG messages too. Trying to adhere to a
	  DEBUG output format of "<file>: <function>() - <message>"

2002-09-05 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #853: During a 'sorcery update', after generating the
	  install queue, summon is no longer called, instead cast
	  deals with the downloading & casting with cast --queue.
	* Bug #875: If 'sorcery queue' was called, cat $INSTALL_QUEUE
	  when finished.

2002-09-04 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Applied patch to scribe to fix update iteration. Thanks to
	  Jon Svendsen (Bug #771)

2002-09-04 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Fixed problem some people were having with gtk+ recasting

	* Bug #811: Added -msse and -mfpmath=sse to athlon-4 CFLAGS.

	  shortURL to liburl.
	* Bug #815: Fixed problem where summon was downloading sources

	* Bug #765: Fixed problem passing $OPTS to configure-scripts
	  due to IFS problem.

2002-08-31 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>

	  Peter Schneider-Kamp <peter@schneider-kamp.de>

2002-08-29 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug 271: Added "gaze license" command. Syntax is:
	  'gaze license spell|section|license [spell|section|license ...]'
	  For each spell listed, shows abbreviation of licenses for each
	  license listed in the details file. For each section, shows
	  license info for each spell in the section. For each license,

	* Bug 271: Added text for some of the licenses found in the
	  license list.
	* Bug 271: Added license directory and list of licenses

	* Initial import of libdepends.
	* Moved dependency related function to libdepends.
	* track_manual: should use -z to test if the variable is unset.

	* Fixed caast --fix not working (#750)

2002-08-21 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>

	  option to make multigrimoire act like single grimoire for 0.8.
	  This will be changed if multigrimoire makes it to 1.0.
	* Updated "scribe update" to function properly with new system.
	* Tweaked Scribe to get "scribe add" working properly. Should

	* Bug 715: When setting the distributed compilation

	  set to zero. Should be set to one. Thanks to Robert Helgesson
	  <rycee@home.se>
	* Add GPL text to the sorcery codebase.
	* Inverted main dialog colours, since the grey background wasn't

2002-08-20 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Fixed showstopper where the make override was causing an
	  incorrect status to be returned. This made cast blithely
	  ignore make errors.
	* Changed format of the man pages from gzip, since having
	  gzipped text files as binary in cvs is just silly. Maybe
	  now someone will keep them up to date. :o)
	* Made the first update to the man pages in a very long time.

2002-08-20 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Added sorcery config variable SORCERY_BRANCH to define
	  current branch (devel/stable).

	  be a little more flexible.
	* Added --queue parameter to summon. Will download all entries
	  in the install queue.

	  and re-worked the same feature into the summon file as
	  'summon --queue'
	* Modified sorcery. Split the process of updating into sub-commands
	  based on the sorcery/grimoire split discussions.
	* Removed lech skeleton file from repository. No need to support
	  backwards compatibility any longer.

	* Integrated modify_local_config into sorcery.

2002-08-18 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>

2002-08-13 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #486: Swicthed all sorcery scripts to use #!/bin/bash instead
	  of #!/bin/sh. Since we depend on bash features, might as well be
	  specific.

2002-08-13 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Began cleanup of optimisation selection by splitting the optimize()
	  call in config to two new variables : ARCHITECTURE and
	  OPTIMIZATIONS.

2002-08-12 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added clear_line and progress_bar to libmisc
	* Replaced progress dots with a % bar
	* Added modify_local_config to make adding stuff to local config
	  easier, then made the function readable ;)

2002-08-11 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* More MD5 stuff, now only decompresses the file once.
	* Moved sedit, query, and message to libmisc

2002-08-11 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #241: Added SORCERY_VERSION variable to /etc/sorcery/config

	  version of sorcery is being used can determin the correct
	  behavior to take.

2002-08-12 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Removed size restrictions from dialogs. This causes it to autosize.
	* Moved cabal functions to its own module. Maybe now someone can
	  learn how it works.

2002-08-09 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added patch from bug #336 (M.L.). Uses netselect if available
	  to find fastest mirror. Added config and sorcery-features entry.

	* Added triggers to sorcery modules
	* Merged patch for distributed compile (rycee)

	  by installwatch

2002-07-30 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>

	  concurrent make fails (rycee).
	* Make sedit fail safely (rather than overwriting any files) and
	  return a failure condition.

2002-07-22 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug #481: Made tmpfs optional, settable by a flag called $TMPFS.

2002-07-12 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug #414: Fixed summon_grimoire routine for argumentless summon.
	  1) It tried to set a variable using a dollar sign.
	  2) It should set SPELL to the name of the spell, whereas it set
	  SPELLNAME to the name of the spell, and SPELL was set to the
	  directory. This caused summon_grimoire to fail with the message
	  "Unable to find spell /var/lib/sorcery/grimoire/blah/blah" for every
	  spell in the grimoire.

2002-07-11 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #177: split function 'upgrade_install_queue()' into 3 seperate
	  functions: 'download_install_queue()', 'build_install_queue()',
	  and 'fix_installed_spells()'.
	* Fixed typo in libsorcery from last checkin.
	* Bug #177: completed sorcery update split. Added two additional
	  commands, 'sorcery update_download' and 'sorcery update_build'.
	  Updated the sorcery manpage to reflect the changes.

2002-07-09 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Updated the uid file to reflect the default groups.
	  Also, added a few entries.
	* Added several entries to the gid file, based on some
	  examples from a debian group file.
	* Fixed type in modules/libgrimoire : reference to UID when it
	  should have been GID.

2002-07-08 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Changed gcc2 related functions to use "gcc -dumpversion",
	  rather than "gcc --version", which would spew extra (unnecessary)
	  lines of text. Now just spits out the version and nothing more.
	* Fixed similar error to the add_paths one fixed by Nathan. This time,
	  "gcc2_prepend_path" was called as "prepend_path".

2002-07-07 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Fixed error in libgcc2. Function name is gcc2_add_paths,
	  was called as add_paths.

2002-07-07 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug 366: Renamed all the modules to libfoo. subroutines now finds
	  modules, rather than having them explicitly listed.
	* Fixed Nathan's changelog entry regarding bug #367 (was written as
	  337).

2002-07-07 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* Added CODEX_ROOT and CODEX_URL to /etc/sorcery/config

2002-07-06 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>

2002-07-06 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #333: cvs_add_grimoire will now delete grimoires
	  from the list of grimoires if they're a duplicate of
	  the grimoire being added

2002-07-05 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #367: New directory, url_handlers, was created. All url_* files
	  were moved to this new directory. "url" was modified to obtain
	  url handlers from the url_handlers directory.
	* Bug #333: cvs_add_grimoire now understands a position argument which
	  allows new grimoires to be added at a specified position within the
	  list of grimoires.
	* Bug #366: All files with sorcery bash functions were moved
	  from /var/lib/sorcery to /var/lib/sorcery/modules. The subroutines
	  file was left in /var/lib/sorcery to preserve some level of backwards
	  compatability. The libsorcery and libgrimoire files were be renamed
	  to be sorcery and grimoire. The codexroutines file was renamed to
	  be codex. A new variable, SGL_LIBRARY_MODULES was added which
	  now points to /var/lib/sorcery/modules.
	* Bug #324: Added warning about setting the number of make
	  jobs to be larger than 1.

2002-07-02 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #333: Implemented functions to add and remove
	  grimoires.

2002-07-01 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #159: Added documentation for functions and split
	  "subroutines" file into two files: libgrimoire and
	  libsorcery.
	* Bug #346: If a spell didn't set VERSION, sorcery
	  wouldn't display spells in that section when viewing
	  the sorcery spell->add->(section) menu. Fixed by
	  defaulting the value of VERSION to "-" for display
	  purposes.
	* Bug #347: Fixed help message for sourceforge mirrors
	  entry in sorcery.
	* Bug #340: Fixed mistyping of French KDE mirror site.
	* Bug #341: Removed leach manpage.

2002-06-29 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #334: MAX_CABALS & MAKE_NJOBS variables in
	  etc/sorcery/config can now be overriden with environment
	  variables.
	* Bug #332: modified get_uid_for_account so that it doesn't
	  use bash builtin, read-only UID variable

	  the '.', '-', and '+' special characters.
	* Bug #322: Added gpl to all scripts that needed it and

	  packages.
	* Bug #323: Fixed mispelled word in sorcery feature menu.

2002-06-26 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #286: When a spell is removed (or renamed) from the
	  grimoire, the cached depends information in
	  /var/state/sorcery/depends may still have this removed
	  spell as a dependency. Sorcery was modified to remove
	  stale spells from the depends file if the spell no
	  longer exists.
	* Bug #309: cast now prepends a statement to compile logs
	  with the version of gcc was set in the environment before
	  the build was started.

2002-06-25 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #274: Added a /tmp/sorcery.restore script that
	  can be run if sorcery is interrupted at the wrong time
	  during a 'sorcery update'. Added instructions to
	  sorcery to explain how to use this script. Instructions
	  are printed out during 'sorcery update'.
	* Bug #303: Added hash data structure to the sorcery
	  library.

2002-06-22 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Initial checkin of 'skry' sourcemage menuing system.
	* Initial checkin of uid/gid files. To be used as default
	  users and groups for the system
	* modified uid/gid files to reflect syntax expected by

	* Fixed bug in var/lib/sorcery/subroutines in the
	  get_uid_for_account() & get_gid_for_account()
	  functions. Made grep search at beginning of line "^$1:"
	  to ensure accurate match.

2002-06-22 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #273: "gaze from md5sum" no longer lists all spells
	  that have an md5sum associated with them. Added a "$"
	  to the end of the grepped for string so that it only
	  matches end of path strings rather than strings internal
	  to a path.
	* Bug #172: Fixed the last mispelling (hopefully).
	* Bug #172: Fixed some mispelling in text of message.

2002-06-21 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #265: wait_flag code was be placed in it's own library
	  file and separated from subroutines for modularity reasons.
	* Bug #172: Added more descriptive message when a website cannot
	  be found when running "gaze website <spell>". Also prefix'd
	  the show_website function with "gaze_".
	* Bug #259: Support the ability to gaze the spells that provide
	  a certain feature. I.e.: gaze provides <feature>.

2002-06-20 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #182: Added gaze spider improvements. gaze spider now
	  takes one or more sections and/or spells as arguments,
	  puts more information in the spider log file, and prints
	  out failed urls to the terminal.
	* Bug #221: Fixed gaze purge so that it understands fuzzy
	  downloading.
	* Bug #258: Gaze search now searches spell name and short
	  description (it used to only search long description).
	* Bug #255: Added support for ctan and sourceforge mirrors.

2002-06-19 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #225: Added three new functions to codexroutines,
	  codex_set_current_spell <spell dir>,
	  codex_set_current_spell_by_name <spell name> and
	  codex_get_spell_description <spell direcotry>. .
	  Removed code that directly access the DETAILS file and
	  replaced the code with these functions. Did this
	  so there could be a single, consistent way to access the
	  details of a spell and so that certain global variables
	  would always be set for the current spell. The main factor
	  driving this change was the need to set the GRIMOIRE variable
	  to point to the correct GRIMOIRE when working with
	  spells (needed since multiple grimoires are supported). KDE
	  spells were accessing the GRIMOIRE variable directly so in
	  order to remain backwards compatible, the devel sorcery
	  scripts also needed to provide this variable.

2002-06-18 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Added query to ask if cast --fix should be done. This is
	  a global option. The default for the question is whatever
	  the global option is set to.
	* Bug #174: Added patches to make sorcery more verbose
	  while updating itself.
	* Bug #168: Added optional parameter to mk_source_dir to
	  allow gurus to specify a tmpfs size other than the 1gb
	  default.
	* Bug #152: Added new optimization choices for i386/i486 and
	  "-z combreloc".

2002-06-17 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #213: Added support for directory urls. Allows
	  users to specify a local directory. Summon will
	  tar/compress the directory, then put it into the sorcery
	  spool.
	* Bug #240: Added SOURCEFORGE_URL and CTAN_URL to maintain
	  backwards compatibility with release branch spells.

2002-06-16 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #20: Add option to be able to turn off "gather_docs"
	  post-build step
	* Bug #13: added feature to print out version info on spells
	  and sections.

2002-05-04 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bugzilla bug 14: Fixed bug in sorcery with the way the DIALOG
	  variable was being set. For some reason, the "dialog" program

	  cast checks for the existence of /var/cache/config/
	  creates if necessary
