2005-11-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  unnecessarily, tree9 unit tests uncovered this bug

2005-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  is the protocol, instead let the url handler fill it in while
	  cracking the url.
	* url_handlers/url_svn: use true svn:// urls by default rather than
	  assuming http://. If the hint "old_svn_compat" is specified
	  use old behavior of inserting http://. All svn based spells
	  in test grimoire already do this.
	* url_handlers/url_svn_http, url_handlers/url_svn_ssh:
	  add handlers for svn+http and svn+ssh, these are trivially
	  similar to url_svn, common code used where possible.
	* libsummon: include svn_ssh and svn_http as tree downloads

2005-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery, sorcery: remove static flag altogether, people can now
	  use the custom optimization flags menu for such things.

	  accident waiting to happen.
