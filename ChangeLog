	* etc/sorcery/url: remove mirror.isurf.ca, adam has disappeared
	  with no indication he is going to re-populate it.

2005-11-23 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* liburl: fix url_crack to pass "$@" not just $1

2005-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dl_handlers/dl_svn: echo the command being used, do not assume http
	  is the protocol, instead let the url handler fill it in while
	  cracking the url.
	* url_handlers/url_svn: use true svn:// urls by default rather than
	  assuming http://. If the hint "old_svn_compat" is specified
	  use old behavior of inserting http://. All svn based spells
	  in test grimoire already do this.
	* url_handlers/url_svn_http, url_handlers/url_svn_ssh:
	  add handlers for svn+http and svn+ssh, these are trivially
	  similar to url_svn, common code used where possible.
	* libsummon: include svn_ssh and svn_http as tree downloads

	* dl_wget: remove spurious declaration of WGET_OPTIONS that
	  munged all the options previous set

2005-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery, sorcery: remove static flag altogether, people can now
	  use the custom optimization flags menu for such things.
	  Suggesting static through the pre-baked options is an
	  accident waiting to happen.
