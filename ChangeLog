	* libsorcery: properly handle missing tablets
	* build_api/common: setup shortcut variables for libtablet, this

	  cracking the url.
	* url_handlers/url_svn: use true svn:// urls by default rather than
	  assuming http://. If the hint "old_svn_compat" is specified
	  use old behavior of inserting http://. All svn based spells
	  in test grimoire already do this.
	* url_handlers/url_svn_http, url_handlers/url_svn_ssh:
	  add handlers for svn+http and svn+ssh, these are trivially
	  similar to url_svn, common code used where possible.

	  not needed
