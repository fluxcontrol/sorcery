	* libcodex: made a few trivial optimisations, making the remaining relevant
	  functions return by reference
	  fixed ENTERED typo in codex_clear_current_spell and two comments
	* grimoire.5, libcodex, libtablet: made BUILD_API=2 the default
	* libmisc: simplified and sped up is_sorcery_var
	* dispel: made downgrading more user friendly #11749; now a list of
	  possible versions is displayed to choose from and the version
	  doesn't need to be specified on the commandline anymore
