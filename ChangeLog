	* Added "fix" to scribe. Will now help users repair metadata if it's

	  summon & sorcery scripts.

	  'update_install_queue' to describe it better.

2002-09-10 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Split the conversion routines out of ./install. Users
	  changing from pre-0.8 will need to run convert /immediately/
	  after installing the new sorcery.. their updates WILL break
	  otherwise (unless sorcery is updated last). A solution is to

	  control characters.

	  $TRUE_GRIMOIRE. They were screwing up libcodex and
	  causing /var/lib/sorcery/grimore to end up in the codex
	  list. This can't happen, so they are removed.
	* Updated Summon to print help if no params.

2002-09-06 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Formatting DEBUG output to be a little easier to follow. Took out
	  some really spammy DEBUG messages too. Trying to adhere to a
	  DEBUG output format of "<file>: <function>() - <message>"

2002-09-05 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #853: During a 'sorcery update', after generating the

	  when finished.

	* Call optimize() after invoke_gcc2() so that CFLAGS is set correctly.

2002-08-23 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Fixed caast --fix not working (#750)
	* Made progress_bar rendering smoother (#729)
	* Fixed gtk+ bug (#732)
	* Probable fix for prune problem (#737). Not sure how it fixed
	  it though...

2002-08-23 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Set SORCERY_VERSION="devel" so that when users track
	  sorcery-devel, they can tell.

2002-08-23 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Removed self references in the SEE ALSO sections.
	* Added libgraph from Paul's graph.sh.

2002-08-22 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Fixed 'sorcery queue' to work right.
	* Minor spelling changes in sorcery, summon & libsorcery.

2002-08-22 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Removing temporary uncompressed files after md5sum
	* Made cast --queue actualy exist (later fixed properly
	  by Nick)
	* Fixed minor typo in install
	* It's OK to not have and MD5 sum in a spell now
	* Fixed problem with casting gcc and the second build
	  directory

2002-08-22 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Typo: "genreated"
	* Bug 702: Moved grimoire man page to section 5 (file formats),
	  where it belongs.
	* Added man pages for scribe and skry.
	* Updated all man pages slightly.

2002-08-21 Ryan Abrams <rabrams@sourcemage.org>
	* Edited libcodex to add overwrite option to codex_add_grimoire
	* Edited scribe to use codex_add_grimoire. Will always use overwrite
	  option to make multigrimoire act like single grimoire for 0.8.
	  This will be changed if multigrimoire makes it to 1.0.
	* Updated "scribe update" to function properly with new system.
	* Tweaked Scribe to get "scribe add" working properly. Should
	  be successful now. Does require $CODEX_ROOT to exist however.
	* Added codex_remove_duplicates to libcodex
	* fixes to "overwrite" tag in codex_add_grimoire
	* added codex_add_grimoire and codex_remove_grimoire to scribe
	* lots of testing of multigrimoire
	* still implemented as single grimoire, using multigrimoire core
	* Edited installer to convert to new codex format upon first install

2002-08-21 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Modified /etc/sorcery/dialogrc colors a bit. based on Ryans
	  suggestion.
	* Updated /etc/sorcery/config to use download.sourcemage.org
	  as SORCERY_URL
	* Sorcery 0.8.0 released.

2002-08-21 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug 715: When setting the distributed compilation
	  volunteers to an empty string the number of makejobs was
	  set to zero. Should be set to one. Thanks to Robert Helgesson
	  <rycee@home.se>
	* Add GPL text to the sorcery codebase.
	* Inverted main dialog colours, since the grey background wasn't
	  very nice.

2002-08-20 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* added functionality to libhash (hash_get_table et al)
	* added sourceforge mirrors
	* fixed weird div by zero error in progress bar

2002-08-20 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Fixed showstopper where the make override was causing an
	  incorrect status to be returned. This made cast blithely
	  ignore make errors.
	* Changed format of the man pages from gzip, since having
	  gzipped text files as binary in cvs is just silly. Maybe
	  now someone will keep them up to date. :o)
	* Made the first update to the man pages in a very long time.

2002-08-20 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Added sorcery config variable SORCERY_BRANCH to define
	  current branch (devel/stable).
	* Changed the perl line from /var/lib/sorcery/excluded to
	  be a little more flexible.
	* Added --queue parameter to summon. Will download all entries
	  in the install queue.
	* Moved feature where summon downloads all spells to --all
	  parameter, instead of default behavior when summon is run
	  with no parameters.
	* Removed download_install_queue() function from libsorcery
	  and re-worked the same feature into the summon file as
	  'summon --queue'
	* Modified sorcery. Split the process of updating into sub-commands
	  based on the sorcery/grimoire split discussions.
	* Removed lech skeleton file from repository. No need to support
	  backwards compatibility any longer.
	* config now has SORCERY_URL, to help with new sorcery spell.

2002-08-18 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added MD5 d/l check options to sorcery.
	* Integrated modify_local_config into sorcery.

2002-08-18 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Cleaned up rm_source_dir, since not everything was removed when
	  not using tmpfs. Also removed duplicated effort in mk_source_dir.

2002-08-17 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Finished the optimisation changes.

2002-08-15 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Fixed netselect stuff so it only pings if the file isn't in
	  the cache already.
	* Cleaned up the "is it in the cache" checking.
	* Added a few functions to hash stuff

2002-08-15 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Phase two of optimisation cleanup. Machine definitions are now
	  seperate files in /var/lib/sorcery/archspecs

2002-08-13 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #486: Swicthed all sorcery scripts to use #!/bin/bash instead
	  of #!/bin/sh. Since we depend on bash features, might as well be
	  specific.

2002-08-13 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Began cleanup of optimisation selection by splitting the optimize()
	  call in config to two new variables : ARCHITECTURE and
	  OPTIMIZATIONS.

2002-08-12 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added clear_line and progress_bar to libmisc
	* Replaced progress dots with a % bar
	* Added modify_local_config to make adding stuff to local config
	  easier, then made the function readable ;)

2002-08-11 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* More MD5 stuff, now only decompresses the file once.
	* Moved sedit, query, and message to libmisc

2002-08-11 Nick Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #241: Added SORCERY_VERSION variable to /etc/sorcery/config
	  So spells which might behave differently depending on which
	  version of sorcery is being used can determin the correct
	  behavior to take.

2002-08-12 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Removed size restrictions from dialogs. This causes it to autosize.
	* Moved cabal functions to its own module. Maybe now someone can
	  learn how it works.

2002-08-11 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Fix for bug #622, semicolons missing.

2002-08-11 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* New dialogrc to match the website colour scheme.

2002-08-10 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added MD5 sum checking of main source file when casting
	  including entry in sorcery menu.

2002-08-11 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Added GPL boilerplate to a few more files.

2002-08-09 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added patch from bug #336 (M.L.). Uses netselect if available
	  to find fastest mirror. Added config and sorcery-features entry.

2002-08-08 Paul Mahon <dufflebunk@dufflebunk.homeip.net>
	* Added triggers to sorcery modules
	* Merged patch for distributed compile (rycee)
	* Pulled out functions that read and modify the state files
	  into a module
	* Created new module (libmisc) for functions that are not sorcery
	  related but help make things easier.
	* Fix for bug 611, added track_manual for files that aren't caught
	  by installwatch

2002-07-30 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug #532: Override calls to make, to allow fallback when a
	  concurrent make fails (rycee).
	* Make sedit fail safely (rather than overwriting any files) and
	  return a failure condition.

2002-07-22 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug #481: Made tmpfs optional, settable by a flag called $TMPFS.

2002-07-19 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Added FALLBACK_URL to /etc/sorcery/config

2002-07-12 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug #414: Fixed summon_grimoire routine for argumentless summon.
	  1) It tried to set a variable using a dollar sign.
	  2) It should set SPELL to the name of the spell, whereas it set
	  SPELLNAME to the name of the spell, and SPELL was set to the
	  directory. This caused summon_grimoire to fail with the message
	  "Unable to find spell /var/lib/sorcery/grimoire/blah/blah" for every
	  spell in the grimoire.

2002-07-11 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Bug #177: split function 'upgrade_install_queue()' into 3 seperate
	  functions: 'download_install_queue()', 'build_install_queue()',
	  and 'fix_installed_spells()'.
	* Fixed typo in libsorcery from last checkin.
	* Bug #177: completed sorcery update split. Added two additional
	  commands, 'sorcery update_download' and 'sorcery update_build'.
	  Updated the sorcery manpage to reflect the changes.

2002-07-09 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Updated the uid file to reflect the default groups.
	  Also, added a few entries.
	* Added several entries to the gid file, based on some
	  examples from a debian group file.
	* Fixed type in modules/libgrimoire : reference to UID when it
	  should have been GID.

2002-07-08 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Changed gcc2 related functions to use "gcc -dumpversion",
	  rather than "gcc --version", which would spew extra (unnecessary)
	  lines of text. Now just spits out the version and nothing more.
	* Fixed similar error to the add_paths one fixed by Nathan. This time,
	  "gcc2_prepend_path" was called as "prepend_path".

2002-07-07 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Fixed error in libgcc2.  Function name is gcc2_add_paths,
	  was called as add_paths.

2002-07-07 Chris Brien <christopher_brien@hotmail.com>
	* Bug 366: Renamed all the modules to libfoo. subroutines now finds
	  modules, rather than having them explicitly listed.
	* Fixed Nathan's changelog entry regarding bug #367 (was written as
	  337).

2002-07-07 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* Added CODEX_ROOT and CODEX_URL to /etc/sorcery/config

2002-07-06 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* Bug #368: New optimisations flags for gcc3 (Chris)

2002-07-06 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #333: cvs_add_grimoire will now delete grimoires
	  from the list of grimoires if they're a duplicate of
	  the grimoire being added

2002-07-05 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #367: New directory, url_handlers, was created.  All url_* files
	  were moved to this new directory.  "url" was modified to obtain
	  url handlers from the url_handlers directory.
	* Bug #333: cvs_add_grimoire now understands a position argument which
	  allows new grimoires to be added at a specified position within the
	  list of grimoires.
	* Bug #366: All files with sorcery bash functions were moved
	  from /var/lib/sorcery to /var/lib/sorcery/modules.  The subroutines
	  file was left in /var/lib/sorcery to preserve some level of backwards
	  compatability.  The libsorcery and libgrimoire files were be renamed
	  to be sorcery and grimoire.  The codexroutines file was renamed to
	  be codex.  A new variable, SGL_LIBRARY_MODULES was added which
	  now points to /var/lib/sorcery/modules.
	* Bug #324: Added warning about setting the number of make
	  jobs to be larger than 1.

2002-07-02 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #333: Implemented functions to add and remove
	  grimoires.

2002-07-01 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #159: Added documentation for functions and split
	  "subroutines" file into two files: libgrimoire and
	  libsorcery.
	* Bug #346: If a spell didn't set VERSION, sorcery
	  wouldn't display spells in that section when viewing
	  the sorcery spell->add->(section) menu.  Fixed by
	  defaulting the value of VERSION to "-" for display
	  purposes.
	* Bug #347: Fixed help message for sourceforge mirrors
	  entry in sorcery.
	* Bug #340: Fixed mistyping of French KDE mirror site.
	* Bug #341: Removed leach manpage.

2002-06-29 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #334: MAX_CABALS & MAKE_NJOBS variables in
	  etc/sorcery/config can now be overriden with environment
	  variables.
	* Bug #332: modified get_uid_for_account so that it doesn't
	  use bash builtin, read-only UID variable
	* Bug #331: added url_is_valid function.  Returns true if
	  the given url is a valid url understood by sorcery.

2002-06-28 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #327: hash functions now support field names with
	  the '.', '-', and '+' special characters.
	* Bug #322: Added gpl to all scripts that needed it and
	  added generic copyright notice (Copyright 2002 by the Source
	  Mage Team).  Modified all headers to be the same bpod format.
	* Bug #324: Added support for "-j" option to make (i.e.,
	  "make -j 3" will use three processes in parallel to build
	  packages.
	* Bug #323: Fixed mispelled word in sorcery feature menu.

2002-06-26 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #286: When a spell is removed (or renamed) from the
	  grimoire, the cached depends information in
	  /var/state/sorcery/depends may still have this removed
	  spell as a dependency.  Sorcery was modified to remove
	  stale spells from the depends file if the spell no
	  longer exists.
	* Bug #309: cast now prepends a statement to compile logs
	  with the version of gcc was set in the environment before
	  the build was started.

2002-06-25 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #274:  Added a /tmp/sorcery.restore script that
	  can be run if sorcery is interrupted at the wrong time
	  during a 'sorcery update'.  Added instructions to
	  sorcery to explain how to use this script.  Instructions
	  are printed out during 'sorcery update'.
	* Bug #303:  Added hash data structure to the sorcery
	  library.

2002-06-22 Nicholas K. Jennings <nkj@namodn.com>
	* Initial checkin of 'skry' sourcemage menuing system.
	* Initial checkin of uid/gid files. To be used as default
	  users and groups for the system
	* modified uid/gid files to reflect syntax expected by
	  get_uid_for_account() and get_gid_for_account()
	* Fixed bug in var/lib/sorcery/subroutines in the
	  get_uid_for_account() & get_gid_for_account()
	  functions. Made grep search at beginning of line "^$1:"
	  to ensure accurate match.

2002-06-22 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #273: "gaze from md5sum" no longer lists all spells
	  that have an md5sum associated with them.  Added a "$"
	  to the end of the grepped for string so that it only
	  matches end of path strings rather than strings internal
	  to a path.
	* Bug #172: Fixed the last mispelling (hopefully).
	* Bug #172: Fixed some mispelling in text of message.

2002-06-21 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #265: wait_flag code was be placed in it's own library
	  file and separated from subroutines for modularity reasons.
	* Bug #172: Added more descriptive message when a website cannot
	  be found when running "gaze website <spell>".  Also prefix'd
	  the show_website function with "gaze_".
	* Bug #259: Support the ability to gaze the spells that provide
	  a certain feature.  I.e.:  gaze provides <feature>.

2002-06-20 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #182: Added gaze spider improvements.  gaze spider now
	  takes one or more sections and/or spells as arguments,
	  puts more information in the spider log file, and prints
	  out failed urls to the terminal.
	* Bug #221: Fixed gaze purge so that it understands fuzzy
	  downloading.
	* Bug #258: Gaze search now searches spell name and short
	  description (it used to only search long description).
	* Bug #255: Added support for ctan and sourceforge mirrors.

2002-06-19 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #225: Added three new functions to codexroutines,
	  codex_set_current_spell <spell dir>,
	  codex_set_current_spell_by_name <spell name> and
          codex_get_spell_description <spell direcotry>.  .
	  Removed code that directly access the DETAILS file and
	  replaced the code with these functions.  Did this
	  so there could be a single, consistent way to access the
	  details of a spell and so that certain global variables
	  would always be set for the current spell.  The main factor
	  driving this change was the need to set the GRIMOIRE variable
	  to point to the correct GRIMOIRE when working with
	  spells (needed since multiple grimoires are supported).  KDE
	  spells were accessing the GRIMOIRE variable directly so in
	  order to remain backwards compatible, the devel sorcery
	  scripts also needed to provide this variable.

2002-06-18 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Added query to ask if cast --fix should be done.  This is
	  a global option.  The default for the question is whatever
	  the global option is set to.
	* Bug #174: Added patches to make sorcery more verbose
	  while updating itself.
	* Bug #168: Added optional parameter to mk_source_dir to
	  allow gurus to specify a tmpfs size other than the 1gb
	  default.
	* Bug #152: Added new optimization choices for i386/i486 and
	  "-z combreloc".

2002-06-17 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #213: Added support for directory urls.  Allows
	  users to specify a local directory.  Summon will
	  tar/compress the directory, then put it into the sorcery
	  spool.
	* Bug #240: Added SOURCEFORGE_URL and CTAN_URL to maintain
	  backwards compatibility with release branch spells.

2002-06-16 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #20: Add option to be able to turn off "gather_docs"
	  post-build step
	* Bug #13: added feature to print out version info on spells
	  and sections.
	* Bug #228: Added function to codexroutines that determines
	  if a given name is a spell or a section.
	* Bug #226: gaze section needs to use codex routines
	* Bug #223: Removed dispel linux and apprentice off lines
	  from sorcery script.

2002-06-15 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bug #2: New dependency type - auto_depends
	* Bug #219:  gaze grimoire broken, accesses $GRIMOIRE directly
	* Bug #218:  codexroutines erroneously lists non-directories
	  as sections

          grimoires.

2002-05-04 Nathan Doss <ndoss@mtlaurel.org>
	* Bugzilla bug 14: Fixed bug in sorcery with the way the DIALOG
	  variable was being set.  For some reason, the "dialog" program
	  didn't like having extra spaces between the different command
	  line arguments that were being passed in.

2002-04-06 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* Problem with implementation of CONFIG_LOC stuff which caused
	  'sorcery' to fail has been fixed

2002-04-04 Elaine Forbes <elaine@fwsystems.com>
	* Added to cast .. local management of spell ./configure --options
	  using $CONFIG_LOC var in /etc/sorcery/local/config
	  cast checks for the existence of /var/cache/config/
	  creates if necessary
	* Added option-feature setting to sorcery for $CONFIG_LOC var

2002-03-28 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* Fixed "$FILE" bug, varname is now $FILEPROG instead
	* Changed copy routines in 'install' from 'cp -a DIR /' to
	  'cp -aR DIR/* /DIR/' so it works, even if /DIR is a symlink
	* Added var/lib/sorcery/codex to handle codex/grimoire functions in
	  the future (Nathan Doss)

2002-03-13 Anders Bruun Olsen <anders@bruun-olsen.net>
	* I've gone ahead and made the release (Cervisia rocks!)
	* Fixed UPDATED/ENTERED bug

2002-03-13 Jon Svendsen <jon-sven@frisurf.no>
	* Haha, just kidding, i didn't cut the 0.1.0 release anyway
	  because the command didn't work.

2002-03-13 Jon Svendsen <jon-sven@frisurf.no>
	* Added a ChangeLog
	* branched 0.1 (branch-0_1)
	* cut 0.1.0 release (release-0_1_0)
