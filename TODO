1) make sure install and track root work
2) look into using find as the install log
3) dir permissions
4) install_staged_config_file use install_config_file (might need to modify so 
   that it just moves to the stage root since we'll be doing the staging to the
   system)
5) investigate config file deletion/installation for stream-lining it
6) rc-update script
7) rip out the filter stagedinstall function replace with POST_INSTALL file
   the environment should be at the root of the translation dir and without
   installwatch running after the POST_INSTALL file is run everything left in 
   the translation dir will be moved to the system

NOTES: 4 & 5 are very similar and may be the same todo item
