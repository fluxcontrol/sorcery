	* libcrossinstall, sorcery: added menu to libcrossinstall for
	  user menu to set install root as he/she pleases, bug #4933.
	* sorcery: rigorous testing with help from sandall produced
	  a need to reset install_root when turning off cross install.

2004-05-19 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>

	* libhash: reverted for now

2004-05-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>

	  which gives us nice -1s per cast

2004-05-17 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* subroutines: added fix from alley_cat to make it "ls"
	  anything independent.
	* libstate: fixed problem with libstate.modify_local_config()
	  not passing more than one arg to be set with variable, thanks
	  to CuZnDragon for pointing out the problem. I am not sure how
	  this came to be... what has changed that might cause this? Or
	  was this around longer and just unnoticed?

2004-05-17 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* subroutines: Fixed 'ls' -> 'ls --color=no'

2004-05-15 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* libdepends: rycee's fix for uninstalled providers

2004-05-08 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Fix for prune in cleanse

2004-05-06 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: slight adjustment to get the fix from yesterday
	  to actually cast the spells chosen, fixes bug #6831.
	* groups, accounts: added scanlogd:126:126, fixes bug #6745.

2004-05-05 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: added a one line check for empty sections
	  when trying to display menu, fixes bug #6829.
	* libsorcery: removed a basename cut show path where
	  the 'provider' listings is coming from (which grimoire),
	  fixes bug #6831 (might want to beautify this later?).
	* libsorcery, libdepends: changed the previous fix to show
	  only the basename and also the version number, fixes #6831.

2004-04-03 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* libdepends: spelling corrections.

2004-04-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast, libdepends: Fixed the private_compute_installed_depends
	  function. The function was failing to properly create a depends
	  tree, and was taking too long to run. It now correctly builds the
	  dependency tree out of installed spells and, most of the processing
	  is now internal to awk, and thus much faster. One libhash operation
	  per installed spell in contrast to three or more depending on the
	  size, and amount of lint in the depends file.

2004-04-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: add ability to override functions in the build pipeline with
	  a FUNCTIONS file in a grimoire or section, and the USE_FUNCTIONS 
	  variable in DETAILS to control it.

2004-04-22 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* Fixed 'empty string' warnings for cast -fix (Bug 6771)

2004-04-21 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery, libgrimoire, libtrack, libaccount, libstate:
	  Move some functions around to hopefully more intuitive places
	  in an effort to make sorcery more modular and understandable.
	  Hopefully these efforts will make sorcery calls less of a web
	  structure.

2004-04-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1 build_api/api2: Add return values to run_build_spell 
	  so that the caller can do special stuff this may end up just getting 
	  passed back to the success/fail api specific function instead. Fixes 
	  issues with compile log generation after aborts from bad md5s during 
	  unpack.

2004-04-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* Adding code for build split. Major changes to cast, libsorcery, 
	  libgrimoire libcodex and libapi. Addition of 
	  /var/lib/sorcery/modules/build_api directory and the files api1 
	  api2 and common to it.

2004-04-18 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

	* libsorcery: removed pre-cleanse code for cleaning stale depneds,
	  part of bug #6534.

2004-04-13 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* libcrossinstall: adding /var/spool/mail to list of dirs to be made
	* Scribe,libcodex: make scribe work with INSTALL_ROOT, adding multiple
	  grimoires not working yet, but "CROSS_INSTALL=on scribe add stable"
	  works fine.

2004-04-12 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Addition of cleanse script and man page

2004-04-10 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

	* usr/sbin/cast: might fix md5sum check for files with spaces

2004-03-31 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* Missed one place where new config toys uses "$SPELL_CONFIG.p"
	  instead of "$SPELL_CONFIG"

2004-03-30 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* File holding persistent variables is "$SPELL_CONFIG.p" now
