2004-10-11 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/alter.8: added warning
	* sustained: added smgl-strip and smgl-prelink:
	  terrible things start happening if these are dispelled.

2004-10-11 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix obvious flaws in upward depends (bug 7496)

2004-10-11 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>

	* man8/alter.8: created, documented seth's alter.

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix buglet where md5sum's are incorrect for a spell file but
	  match elsewhere (say in net-tools) and the spell where we find the
	  files has a - in the name. When this happened cleanse failed to
	  crack the name of the spellname from the md5sum logfile name and thus
	  would report the spell as broken rather than adjusting the
	  logs as needed

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: declare i local in select_provider, bug 7491
	  (thanks sandalle)

2004-10-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

2004-10-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: Adjust ordering of "extra" config files to
	  ease transition to the new setup. Add some entries for the
	  local version of the config files.
	* etc/sorcery/media: remove colors, and call media_init after sourcing 
	  local/media.
	* libmedia: added from patch supplied by Lyon Lemmens with a few
	  minor adjustments.

	  after list_add)

2004-10-05 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix bug 7458, incorrect guess for optional_depends
	  provider, also fix a missing local declaration in optional_depends
	  spell

2004-10-04 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel: fix bug 7454, dispel -d was setting the wrong version

2004-10-03 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery_config.5: created a new manpage
	* grimoire.5, gaze.1: added it

2004-09-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: depends is off if provider selected is "none"

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/common: fix trivial bug 7344, switch order CONFIG_LOC
	  and -x ./configure are checked

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: Improve depends/optional_depends querying to
	  look in more places for answers (bug 7382), handle exiled
	  spells more gracefully (7343), as well as the new "default"
	  answers (bug 6295). Option list for providers only shows actual
	  providers, and only once, without the version (bug 6831), list
	  also indicates what spells are installed already, and supports
	  up to 62 providers.
	* libstate: add routines for adding/searching/removing things from the		  default depends/provider files (bug 6295).
	* etc/sorcery/state: add entries for DEFAULT_DEPENDS and
	  DEFAULT_PROVIDERS.
	* sorcery: Add command line interface to interact with default
	  depends/providers (bug 6295).

	* libapi, libstate: add spell_ok/real_spell_ok function to
	  test for a spell being in any installed state (installed, held,
	  etc.) (bug 7294).

2004-09-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix reversed logic in cleanse --nofix_quick

2004-09-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix md5sum checking to not accept files that were changed
	  but live in currently installed spells. These files are now removed
	  from the spell's md5sum and install log, and placed in a new
	  "possessed log". This is currently for information only, but
	  may someday be used by sorcery.
	* cleanse: wrap --fix summary messages to 80 characters and re-word
	  the "hopeless" message.
	* etc/sorcery/state: add POSSESSED_LOGS entry.

2004-09-27 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* var/lib/sorcery/modules/libcodex: use parameter expansion instead of
	  dirname and basename in codex_set_current_spell
	* var/lib/sorcery/modules/libmisc: use bash code instead of awk and
	  sed in real_persistent_load and real_list_add

2004-09-25 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>

2004-09-20 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* cleanse: added a progress meter, cosmetic fix

2004-09-13 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* var/lib/sorcery/archspecs/sun4u,sun4u64: Use march=v9 instead of v8

2004-09-10 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* accounts, groups: fixed haldaemon account, added haldaemon group,
	  added messagebus user and group (bugs 7317 and 7338)

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* url_cvs: fix bug 7272, check for the file and fail if it isnt there
	* url_svn: add (slightly modified) handler from bug 7228, this is
	  almost completely untested

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* accounts: add "haldaemon" uid and gid for bug 7317

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate, libapi: fix bug 7295, add spell_held to libapi and
	  fix some comments.
	* libstate: add a function that I'll use later for bug 7277 that
	  was already put into libstate

2004-09-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: fix bug 7096, stricter name grepping, and remove
	  some mysterious code

2004-08-23 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libhash: Minor fix to avoid trying to run a variable

2004-08-23 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: adjust handling of exiled to be slightly more ideal
	* libhash: fix exporting of empty hash tables

2004-08-23 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

	* usr/sbin/*: Updated and indented command documentation

2004-08-21 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>

	  redirected (behavior from api1)

2004-08-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/roots,state, libcrossinstall: Fix bug 4534, you can now
	  specify through the install root menu where cache files get stored.

2004-08-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: add a parameter to view the activity log

2004-08-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: fix resurrect to at least respect INSTALL_ROOT
	  still need to make fixing code respect it.

2004-08-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdownload: Small fix to only look at mirror files that really
	  truely contain mirrors for the url we are expanding

2004-08-12 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* cleanse: added a nice summary at the end (bug #749)

2004-08-11 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: Added some mirrors, thanks Ruskie !

2004-08-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* liburl: Fix a missing call to iterator which in its absence
	  made url_rank do nothing (and I just thought it was faster!).
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: Remove some trailing "/"s that I missed.

2004-08-10 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@gmx.net>
	* cast: added a -V option to override VOYEUR (bug #4623),
	  fixed a typo in process_parameters()

2004-08-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 7166, gaze now handles providers and does not
	  incorrectly list them as orphans. The running time appears to
	  be about 3 times faster too.

2004-08-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery, libsorcery: Fix some menu's to modify different local
	  config files now that we've split the config files up. This fixes
	  the problem of not using the selected mirror.

2004-08-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: If after finishing dependency resolution there are no spells
	  to cast (e.g. they were all z-rejected and the user rejected them)
	  print a message and exit 1.
	* libdepends: Add spell to the cannot cast hash when it fails
	  somewhere in dependency resolution.

2004-08-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 5525, gaze compile now supports an optional version
	  parameter.

2004-08-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel, libdispel: Move numerous dispel functions into a library
	* dispel: Fix numerous obvious flaws in the downgrade function
	* dispel: Non-zero exit status on failure.
	* build_api/api2: turn on installwatch at INSTALL, not BUILD
	* cast, build_api/common, libgrimoire, libinitd, libmisc, libcodex,
	  libtrack, scribe, dispel, libdispel, alter: adjust INSTALL_ROOT code
	  to new model.
	* /etc/sorcery/config, state, media, url, roots: split configuration
	  into more files to be more confusing.
	* libgraph: delete
	* cast: remove unused current_sources function (was used before
	  libdownload re-write)
	* summon, sorcery, config: remove xdelta code
	* libsorcery: remove dl_source, get as they've been depreciated also
	  remove testpack which is only called by get and no one missed it.
	* scribe: update to use download_files instead of url_download, since
	  download_files is the prefered frontend for all downloading.
	* libdepends: fiddle with private_run_depends error handling
	* libgrimoire: format warn_rejected and ask_continue_with_rejected
	  and remove useless cats and message calls in favor of a few,
	  properly quoted message calls.
	* libgrimoire: ask_continue_with_rejected remove poor attempt at
	  dealing with the choice to not continue. Instead return 1 like
	  a well behaved function and dont mess with libdepends.
	* libdownload: beta mirror expanding code, as requested by ruskie
	* liburl, url_handlers/*: take advantage of parallelism when
	  netselecting if possible. This is a necessary compliment to the
	  url expanding code in libdownload, which may generate over 200 urls.
	* /etc/sorcery/mirrors/*: remove trailing / from some mirror names
	* install: now takes an optional parameter as to where it should
	  install to.
	* /etc/sorcery/update/...: remove, sorcery is not a spell
	* libmisc: fix progress spinner for bash 3.0
	* libstate: fix obviously broken remove_spell function
	* sorcery, libcrossinstall: Add a new and simple menu for
	  selecting of install/track/state root.
	* libcrossinstall: Remove invoke_cross_environment since we no longer
	  copy everything all over the place for no apparent reason. Rename
	  and modify the routine to install sorcery somewhere else, instead
	  use the install script included with the sorcery distribution.

2004-08-06 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdownload: fixed in order to make it work again (bug 7214), some 
	  small indenting too

2004-08-05 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: Fix for displaying some sorcery text files
	* liblock: Have liblock notice when disks get full and commits fail
	* cleanse: Make cleanse know about provider switching

2004-08-04 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: add redirection of stderr back to pass_three's summon
	  call, otherwise download progress from wget is not logged.
	  Will fix the url handlers later.
	* libdownload: pushd/popd to /tmp for downloading until
	  the url handlers can figure out where to download things

2004-08-03 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* build_api/api1: move the logging to around the build so that 
	  custom builds get logged too.

2004-08-02 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* build_api/{api1,api2,common}, alter, libsorcery, libcast:
	  use process substitution instead of named fifo for compile logging.
	* build_api/{api2,common}: make the config_loc function run outside of
	  the compile log pipeline.
	* archspecs/amd64/x86_{32,64}: -march=k8 instead of xp

2004-08-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: fix enhancement to not
	  forget BUILD/INSTALL failures (oops)

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdownload: check for pon before using it (bug 7196)

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* cast, api1, api2: removed 2>&1 pipe redirection to make SUPER_DEBUG
	  work again

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libaccount: Improved create_account to use parameter instedad of
	  $SECONDARY_GIDS (bug 7190)
	* libaccount: indented function create_account
	* libaccount: added function sanity_checks to prevend ID clashing

2004-08-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libcast: `ls | grep -v` -> `find ...`
	* libcast: fixed if .. then .. else, initd scripts should be installed
	  without warning now
	* libcast: fixed debugging calls referring to wrong fucntion

2004-07-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: fix yesterdays enhancement to not
	  overwrite the compile log (oops)

2004-07-28 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: Add a timestamp for when
	  building/installing completes (bug 7136).

2004-07-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* url_http: Remove useless eval from url_http_call_wget
	
2004-07-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: Move clean_logs into cleanse as a --log option, bug 7171

2004-07-23 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* url_cvs: made it work with both cvs and gcvs (bug #7107)

2004-07-22 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libmisc: fix for list_remove, thanks Richard !
	* libmisc: fix for config_query_option to work for cast -r, and also
	  modified it's output to show [y|n] instead of selected option

2004-07-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: Incorporate the --fix rewrite. Most of this work
	  as done by Paul. I just tied things together :) Also changed
	  indentation to two spaces because I felt like it.
	  These changes should also take care of the last of the "filenames
	  with spaces" problems.

2004-07-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdownload: make FALL_BACKS url list local, this caused a rather
	  annoying problem where SOURCE downloads from fallback, then SOURCE2
	  also needs to download from fallback, but ends up re-downloading
	  SOURCE. The variable should have been set to local. Thanks alley_cat!

2004-07-13 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* libcast: default non-essential init scripts to not be enabled by
	  default.  They are still installed.

2004-07-10 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* cast, sorcery: run /tmp scripts with bash directly.
	  This enables one to mount -o remount,noexec /tmp or set the
	  noexec option in fstab for /tmp.

2004-07-06 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: fix tabs in OMIT_IN variable inside parse_iw, this was
	  causing spells which made symlinks to own the files they were
	  symlinking too. In the case of init.d this was /bin/true.
	* protected: add /bin/true

2004-07-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix config_query to really return 0 in all cases

2004-07-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: move declaration of OPTS above where we source SPELL_CONFIG
	  otherwise we lose all changes to the variable from SPELL_CONFIG

2004-06-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* dispel: missed an api update to remove_depends_status
	* libmisc: fix config_get_option, left out $PERSISTENT_VARIABLES
	  to the real_list_find call (doh! thanks alley_cat)

2004-06-29 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libapi: fix debug calls to call debug properly
	* summon, libsummon: split summon code into a library so
	  cast can download things directly rather than calling summon
	* install: install out of a svn sandbox without copying .svn files
	* build: WIP build script for rolling a sorcery release tarball
	* cast: remove some unused functions, better tmp file directory support
	  cleanup at the right point, remove TEMPORARY HACK. 
	  Add an experimental optional rule to the makefile in order to
	  get rid of the make dependency dropping and bailing out issue
	* libcast, cast: individual spell download logs (rather than
	  dumping the entire log over and over again)
	* build_api/common, cast: move some code in cast_spell to the build_api
	* libdepends: add a big demystifying comment and re-arrange some
	  functions to hopefully be in a more logical arrangement (to
	  me at least). Change the algorithm used to not re-evaluate a spell.
	* cast, libdepends: add flag to recast spells that are depended on
	  and already installed, but not specifed on the command line.
	* libstate, libdepends, sorcery/config: don't commit depends
	  until cast actually succeeds, change libstate calls to require
	  a depends file to look at rather than assumming DEPENDS_STATUS,
	  add config file variables for uncommitted and abandoned depends
	* libhash: add hash_append and hash_debug_dump functions

2004-06-24 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* sorcery:optimization_menu():
	  Added prelink compile-time menu option for alter
	  Sorted compile-time options alphabetically
	  Add what flags are added to HELP
	  Reworded HELPs to fit 80 columns
	* libsorcery:optimize(): unset alphabetically ;)
	  Add COMBRELOC and PRELINK to be unset
	  Add prelink to PARAM case statement, sort alphabetically

2004-06-23 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* alter: modified to respect ARCHIVE=off for undo caches in
	  md5mend.  Now it should allow you to do any alter on systems
	  with almost no disk space needed with ARCHIVE=off.

2004-06-21 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* alter: added, need to write man page, but until then, alter -h
	  --help as well as --about
	  changed around the interface a bit and added strip and strip-all.
	  more FAQ entries.  Close to feature complete?

2004-06-19 Jason Flatt <jflatt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: Modified usage text for remove and reindex to reflect actual
	  operation of script.

2004-06-19 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libapi, libmisc: added persistent_clear function which unsets
	  persistent variables.
	* libcodex: persistent variables loaded before DETAILS are destroyed
	  by persistent_clear instead by persistent_save

2004-06-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* libdepends: fix assumption that a depends line would always exist
	  in work_optional_depends_provider which caused /all/ depends entries
	  for the spell in question to be removed (oops, thanks alley_cat).

2004-06-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* libcodex: DETAILS now also uses persistence
	* libmisc: unset all persistent variables and PERSISTENT_VARIABLES on
	  persistent_save

2004-06-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libmisc, libapi: fixed wrong commend about returning values

2004-06-18 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* libdepends: PREPARE now also uses persistence

2004-06-17 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: fix assumption that a depends line would always exist
	  in work_depends_provider which caused /all/ depends entries for
	  the spell in question to be removed (oops, thanks alley_cat).

2004-06-10 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Fix removal count in prune() if there is nothing to remove

2004-06-09 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>

2004-06-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	* libcast, build_api/common: make sure we get rid of C_LOG and C_FIFO
	  in all cases

2004-06-01 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: sound off option no longer exits, bug #6940.

2004-06-01 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* scribe: reindented

2004-05-31 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* liburl, url_handlers: Reworked the way netselect works, not quite
	  ideal yet, but at least it will rank everything. More work later...
	* libdownload, libsorcery: Moved download related code to libdownload
	  and rewrote most of the code such that now there should be a better
	  interface to the download process any of the scripts could use.
	  Also made update_sorcery use this new interface.
	* libcodex: ignore the output from a popd in codex_set_grimoire.
	* summon: Fixed to use new interface and to support printing of
	  source and urls. Also added a "raw" mode to re-read output from
