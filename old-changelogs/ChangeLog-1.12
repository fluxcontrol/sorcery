	* libdispel: use filter_configs to incorporate spell level
	  filtering, also concludes the fix for bug 7550

	  see bug 8263
	* etc/sorcery/config: remove UPDATE_SCRIPT, its defined in sorcery now

	  be initial downloads, it seems that the progress bar can consume a
	  bit too much time just updating if we guess the size incorrectly.

2005-02-28 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: combine number of jobs menu and distcc hosts menu into
	  a single menu, add a field for jobs per host rather than always
	  doing num_hosts+1 for the number of jobs, addresses bug 6432.
	* libgrimoire: enhance make() function to use
	  num_hosts*jobs_per_host+make_njobs for the number of make
	  jobs. Fixes bug 6432
	* libsorcery: make invoke_build_dir to set a USE_DISTCC variable
	  due to the buggy way that spell writers have been told to disable
	  distcc and the way run_compiler works. Provide a new more robust
	  way to disable distcc with DISABLE_DISTCC. Also add a long comment
	  explaining all this stuff for the future explorer.
	* build/run_compiler: respect USE_DISTCC as set from libsorcery
	  instead of just looking at DISTCC_HOSTS
	* compile_config: add a new field for jobs per distcc host

	  upwards to the point of exit despite our best efforts.
	* cleanse: fix output of --nofix_quick to not indicate that
	  cleanse ever had any intention of actually fixing anything

	  (not that they normally make sense either).
	* libresurrect: fix some issues with log pointers in tablet
	  comment off backup/rollback code, im not sure its necessary,
	  will think about it later. Test out conflicts, they work,
	  surprise surprise.
	  
2005-02-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libresurrect: try out handle_changed_config codepath, seems

	  base directory will be there too.
	* libtrack: strip empty lines generated from seperate_state_files
	* cast: fix logic that determines if the spell should be compiled
	  or resurrected.

	  gaze install's dont flash output and clear it immediatly

2005-02-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  by using ls and wildcard expansion to match any $BUILD variant.

2005-01-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: make sure $TMP_DIR is always defined since
	  there were some extra scripts that hooked into sorcery and didnt

	  other sorcery scripts do.

2005-01-09 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>

	  (or just the dependents).

2004-12-30 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libgrimoire: make sure installwatch is OFF for dispel
	  in prepare_install otherwise pesky log files get into the

	  differently by dispel and soon resurrect
	* sorcery: fix some spacing and clean up some files and stuff
	* build: ignore the {arch} directory
	* cleanse, alter, cast, gaze, build_api/api1, build_api/api2,
	  libdispel, libgrimoire, libtrack, url_rsync: use TMP_DIR
	  instead of /tmp or something else (bug 7536)
	* libmisc: make mk_tmp_dirs have an optional parameter for the base dir
	* cleanse: fix up the startup code to use mk_tmp_dirs, use the
	  volatiles file and log_adjuster as needed
	* libdispel: fix up code to use tablet if its there, and treat
	  config files specially

2004-12-07 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: Quote $@ for multi-word parameters

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* config: add a default umask of 0022
	* sorcery, libsorcery: Add a menu for setting the umask (bug 7510)
	  this was from a patch written by Jeremy Blosser

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bug 7673 remove some unused cast parameters

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix gaze size to use du instead of ls which has different
	  columns on different boxes. (bug 7750)

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: reload local config after adjusting the
	  arch/optimization settings so they show up in the menu if you
	  run it again
	* archspecs/ia32/c3/*: add some archspecs for c3 (bug 7735)

2004-12-07 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix order of parameters in config_query_list to select_list
	* libcast: make query_services check for the xinetd.d and init.d
	  directories before trying to find things in them

2004-12-03 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man5/sorcery_config.5: add STORE_CONF_LOG option.

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: fix restore script to actually work, the previous
	  work was done with poor knowledge of how here documents work,
	  variables are resolved at creation time (which allows the script
	  to actually know where the source might be kept and what the
	  branch is) but the value of the input parameters were being
	  removed (namely $1). Also fixed a similar and latent bug in
	  system-update along the same lines. Bug 7704.

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: add menu item for STORE_CONF_LOG
	* config: add default value for STORE_CONF_LOG (off)
	* libcast: if STORE_CONF_LOG is on, store config.log (if it
	  exists) in the compile log (bug 6776).

2004-12-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: make select_list have another parameter, which defines
	  the default choice
	* cleanse: update calls to select_list to pass a default (of 0) in
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: make
	  default_post_build/default_post_install call the isntall_initd
	  and install_xinetd functions instead of in run_build/run_install
	* libcast: remove old use_initd and use_xinetd functions for the
	  newer query_services routine which handles both and asks about
	  both installing and enabling/disabling services. It also stores
	  values in persistent variables. Also re-write the install_initd
	  and install_xinetd functions to use the new persistent variables
	  and correctly handle installing/enabling/disabling. Also make xinetd
	  an optional depends if the spell has an xinetd script that
	  is installed. This is bug 1817.
	* libdepends: update run_others to use the query_services function
	  instead of the old use_initd and use_xinetd functions, also load
	  and save persistent variables since query_services now uses them
	* libgrimoire: remove install_initd_confs (yet another layer of useless 
	  indirection)

2004-12-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* x86_32, x86_64: revert -march-k8 back to -march=athlon-xp
	  since gcc 3.4 isnt in the test/stable grimoires yet.

2004-11-28 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: create locks and wait before updating
	* cast: colorize lock messages

2004-11-27 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* libhash: Fix quoting

2004-11-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* mirrors/SOURCEFORGE: update mirrors as per bug 7675

2004-11-22 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man/sorcery_config.5: added install_root options

2004-11-23 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: fix stupid typo in list_add that made persistent
	  variables get added more than once.

2004-11-22 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: saner color choice
	* cast: fix overview at the end to show dependencys dropped
	  by make after errors.

2004-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix mk_tmp_dir weirdness

2004-11-22 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix cast to carry return codes up, otherwise dependencys
	  weirdness occurss.

2004-11-21 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: quote a bunch of things that were quoted in comparisons

2004-11-21 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/summon.8: updated manpage
	* man8/cast.8: added some missing options

2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: fix bug 7662, scribe wasnt creating a file for the
	  transaction and so the transaction failed thinking there was a
	  write error.

2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: remove a mysterious leftover line, bug 7657
	* url_rsync, libsorcery: apply patches from Eric listed below

2004-11-20 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* url_rsync: Don't depend on a grimoire existing to determine
	  if rsync is available. Bug #7661
	* libsorcery: Now uncompresses Sorcery to $INSTALL_ROOT/usr/src
	  instead of /usr/src. Bug #7659
  
2004-11-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: fix bug 7655, scribe add doesnt work without a url (oops)
	* Changelog: fix some entries that used spaces instead of tab

2004-11-19 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/sorcery.8: update
	* man8/scribe.8: update and rewrite
	* man8/dispel.8: updated

2004-11-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: unset CAST_PASS in pass_three and pass_four, if those
	  passes call cast (like from cleanse --fix called from resurrect)
	  then cast gets confused. (bug 7648)
	* libmisc: make config_query_list show the question (bug 7646)

2004-11-18 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* man8/cast.8: rewrite, nice lean page now the config stuff moved

2004-11-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: make default for MD5SUM_DL ask_risky instead of
	  off, some users have had bad downloads and not known it because they
	  didnt know to configure download integrity checking.

2004-11-11 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmedia: dont call goodbye at the end of the sound theme menu
	* sorcery: remove references to $CAST, mainly $CAST --fix because
	  cleanse --fix is to be used

2004-11-10 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: fix a bunch of stupid problems in update that either came in
	  from a bad merge or were somehow overlooked...

2004-11-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* alter, cast, dispel, invoke, scribbler, scribe, sorcery: fix
	  bug 7524 again, for real this time, I hope...this is getting annoying

2004-11-08 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: scribe u is scribe update, not unlocalize
	* scribe: fix update to actually unpack and install the tarball

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate: make codex_is_local use local variables
	* libcodex: make codex_find_spell_or_section_by_name not declare
	  variables its returning local

2004-11-04 Neuron <vlmarek@volny.cz>
	* alter, cast, dispel, invoke, scribbler, scribe, sorcery: fixed
	  bug 7524, then environment is conserved when switching from regular
	  user to root

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: forgot to make update code look at $grimoire to
	  determine if the grimoire is local not $i in the case of updating
	  all grimoires (oops).

2004-11-03 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api2: fix a backquoting error (oops)

2004-11-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build, install: strip out .arch-id files in case run from arch
	* cabal, libcabal, sorcery, config: move libcabal to its own utility
	  and remove unnecessary references to it in the sorcery script and
	  config file.
	* cabal: use modify_local_config in the one location that modifies
	  the configuration
	* libsorcery, sorcery, libwait_flag: remove libwait_flag as its mostly
	  unused and provides no useful functionality (trying to weed
	  out unnecessary feature creep) bug 7549.
	* url_cvs, url_rsync, url_svn: ensure S_FILE is declared local
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: tabs -> spaces, fix line
	  justification where a poor job was done
	* libcast: move report_install closer to its friends and use
	  let instead of (( ))
	* libtrack: remove syms_not_owned (depreciated and unused)
	* build_api/common, libgrimoire: move real_prepare_install,
	  gather_docs and install_pam_confs out of libgrimoire and into
	  common since they are only called during the build pipeline anyway
	* scribe: rewrite majority of the code. Change parameter parsing
	  to just figure out the subcommand, hand off the rest of the parsing
	  to the subroutines, this makes it so that commands that dont need
	  "from url" dont use it. Stop assuming that grimoires live in
	  CODEX_ROOT. Allow rsyncing and dont needless tar and untar rsync
	  grimoires. Fix bug 7519 scribe add only adds once. Grimoire
	  names now use first match semantics for naming, but can be
	  named by prepending subdirectory names: eg codex/stable.
	* libcodex: hand in hand with scribe updates, update this library
	  in a number of ways. Reorganize the functions. Remove tmpfs
	  functions. Optimize the heck out of as many functions as
	  possible, add a codex_set_current_spell_quick to speed up
	  spell sourcing in situations where it needs to be really fast
	  like scribe --sweep (converting that code is not done yet).
	* libsecurity, gaze: fix function call names based on changes 
	  to libcodex
	* scribe.8: update manual
	
2004-11-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* build_api/api1, build_api/api2: remove call to install_services
	* libgrimoire: remove install_services (bug 7598)

2004-11-01 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* mirrors/GNU: fix the mirror listing, bug 7591

2004-10-31 Paul Mahon <pmahon@sourcemage.org>
	* Minor fixes to bashdocs

2004-10-27 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sustained: remove rpmunpack, spells that need it now depend on it

2004-10-26 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: fix use_xinetd to actually work at an acceptable level
	  fix install_xinetd to install enabled and disabled services, and
	  to chmod +x enabled services and chmod -x disabled services. This
	  is a crutch until bug 1817 is fixed.
	* libgrimoire: remove install_xinetd_confs because it was a useless
	  function under install_xinetd, it enables the services and then
	  restarts xinetd which is bad.

2004-10-21 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: deal with the case of load_build_api failing
	* libcast: load_build_api fails if it doesnt recognize the api
	  this is anticipating the day we have api3, and this version
	  of sorcery is old. (bug 7559)
	* build_api/common: silence a popd

2004-10-21 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* scribbler: made su work

2004-10-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: replace spell_okay with spell_ok (oops)

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: Fix bug 7544, remove cast --fix, otherwise known as 459
	  lines of old stale code.
	* cleanse: replace status_okay with spell_okay, and remove some
	  unused functions left over from the --fix rewrite.

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bug 7532, remove lots of inconsistent tabs from
	  cast, except for ones in the cast --fix code

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: fix bug 6423, filter now uses regular expressions
	* excluded, protected: fixed to use regular expressions

2004-10-19 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: make list_add really seperate on spaces only, this
	  works around the case where a spell commits the sin of changing
	  IFS on us.

2004-10-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* archspecs/g4+: fix bug 7198, if not using gcc2 use mcpu=7450

2004-10-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* alter, cleanse, dispel, gaze, scribbler, scribe, sorcery, summon:
	  add call to mk_tmp_dirs to set TMP_DIR globally
	* gaze: set TMP_DIR to /tmp just in case for some strange reason it
	  calls something that ends up needing it
	* cast: remove mk_tmp_dirs definition and error handling case
	* libmisc: move mk_tmp_dirs here and improve it to have tons of
	  useless paranoid sanity checking, and to exit for the caller
	  if it fails.

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: change most echo calls to message
	* url_rsync: clean up a few loose ends, try to at least pave
	  the way for a new better rsync module that does both file
	  downloads and source tree downloads

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe: set FILE in do_update otherwise funny things happen
	  also remove a duplicate pushd

2004-10-16 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: fix bugs 7529 and 7531, check a little more carefully
	  for temp dir creation, and remove silly code from cast --fix.
	  Also make it slightly more obvious that cast --fix is depreciated.

2004-10-16 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* url_rsync: add progress bar for anxious users
	* libmisc: PROGRESS_SPINNER not local so it gets carried on
	  to the next run of the function

2004-10-15 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: apply patch to architecture menu from Benoit Papillault,
	  the menu now has a cancel button and defaults to the previously
	  chosen architecture. Bug 7520.

2004-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: make conflicts work again, bug 7525

2004-10-14 Karsten Behrmann <BearPerson@sourcemage.org>
	* url_http: fix bug 7521, remains of fuzz code removed

2004-10-14 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: fix bug 7518, handle the case of an empty (but existing)
	  install queue.

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: emergency quickfix for bug 7516, add
	  optimize back to config because more things use it than i thought
	  did (oops!)

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* libdepends: applied rycee's suggested fix for bug 6303, gaze
	  depends now understands the spell(PROVIDER) syntax and gives a
	  more complete listing of dependent spells.

2004-10-13 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* etc/sorcery/config: add UPDATEFIX variable
	* sorcery: add item to feature menu for UPDATEFIX
	* libsorcery: only do cleanse --fix basesystem if $UPDATEFIX == "on"

2004-10-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cast: add flags to set custom CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS
	  values, and a --no-opts flag to disable the use of the
	  optimization flags set through sorcery menus and archspecs
	  (but not the command line)
	* sorcery: Add a menu for setting custom optimization flags,
	  add call to optimize inside optimization menu
	* libsorcery: Make optimize work with features describe above
	* etc/sorcery/config: Remove call to optimize, its called in the
	  build api's and sorcery where needed. Please let me know if its
	  required elsewhere.
	* etc/sorcery/dialogrc: change tag_selected_color to be readable
	  when selected (red on red is bad)
	* man8/cast.8: update with info on new cast options

2004-10-12 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* cleanse: fix bug 7500 ignore score files in /var/games when
	  md5sum checking, and bug 7507, resurrect causes make to behave
	  strangely
