When the release stream is changed the current ChangeLog is moved to
this directory and suffixed with the old release stream version. A
new ChangeLog is created for the new stream. This allows for parallel streams
(one in devel, one in test) and a clear seperation of what was fixed in
each stream. Changes dont get polluted from one stream to another and
its obvious at release time what was changed in a given release.

The ChangeLogs starting at 1.12 and earlier were not made this way,
they were split up based on revision control history and when branches
were done, no changes were removed in this process.
