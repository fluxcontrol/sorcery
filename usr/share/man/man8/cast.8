.B cast
emacs
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.I cast
is part of the
.I sorcery
source-code package management suite. It is a command-line tool
for automatically retrieving, unpacking, compiling, installing, and
tracking software installations. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "-f, --fix"
Used to be: Discover and fix broken spells. Now removed.
.P
Use
.I cleanse --fix
instead.
.SS "-s"
First download all spells, then cast.
Normal cast behavior is to download in the background while compiling.
This disables that behavior.
.SS "--deps"
Determines dependencies for the given spell(s) and casts the dependencies,
but does not cast the given spell(s) itself.
.SS "--cflags, --cxxflags, --ldflags, --cppflags"
Set custom cflags/cxxflags/ldflags/cppflags values to override those found in
arch specs, and set through the sorcery menu.
.SS "--no-opts"
Disable the use of optimization flags from arch specs and the sorcery
menu, only use those specified on the command line with --cflags,
--cxxflags, or --ldflags.
.SS "-c, --compile"
Compiles spell even if there is a compile cache in /var/cache/sorcery.
Otherwise, it would just resurrect (untar) it.
Helpful when the system configuration changes.
.SS "-r, --reconfigure"
This will prompt you again for optional dependencies
and configuration options, even those you answered before.
Implies
.IR "-c" .
.SS "-g, --grimoire [grimoire names ...]"
Use only the specified grimoires for this cast.
NOTE: If there are any cross-grimoire dependencies on unspecified grimoires they will not work. The target spell will not be found. To avoid this, specify all relevant grimoires to the -g parameter in the order you wish them to be searched.
.SS "--from directory"
Specify an alternate directory to search for cached sources.
An alternate to /var/spool/sorcery.
Usually though, you'd just copy the source to /var/spool/sorcery.
.SS "--queue"
Re-casts all spells in the install queue, as generated for example by
.BI sorcery " queue"
.SS "-V on|off"
Overrides the VOYEUR option, which specifies whether or not
compile output should be displayed. Helpful if you usually have
it off and want to see where an error is.
.SS "-d, --download"
Forces redownloading of sources, sources are freshly downloaded
even when we already have them.
.SS "-R, --recast-down"
recasts all the spells the given spell(s) depend on
(and the ones they depend on ...).
This might be quite a lot of spells.
.SS "-B, --recast-up"
recasts all the spells that depend on the given spell(s)
(and the ones they depend on ...).
.SS "-O, --recast-optional [option]"
If a spell being built has spells which could optionally depend on it, but those
dependencies are disabled, ask to recast the dependee. Option can be one of: "always",
"ask-yes", "ask-no", or "ignore"; it defaults to what is set via the sorcery menu.
.SS "-Z, --lazy-updates [option]"
Perform updates on installed spells that need updates. Optional parameter are the same as above.
.SS "-b, --force-base-dep"
Force all spells to depend on basesystem.
.SS "-h, --help"
Display short help.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The environment is set using the sorcery configuration files.
See
.I sorcery_config(5)
.SH ADVANCED USAGE
Casting from an alternate spell cache.

.B --from
/root/sgl/personal/cache
emacs
.SH "NOTES"
Do not include 
.SM version
or
.SM section
name when specifying a package. To get complete listing of software packages
type
.I gaze grimoire
.P
If spell fails during a cast, try recasting it with
.I cast -r -c
to reconfigure and recompile.
.SH "COMMENTS"
Unless the
.B --from
option is specified cast will always check the
.I /var/spool/sorcery
directory first to see if the package exists. If the package does not
exist it downloads the package via the Internet.
