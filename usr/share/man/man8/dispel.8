such as when it is needed as a dependency.

.SS "--notriggers"
disables handling of "triggers" for this session,
the automatic recasting/dispelling of other spells when

(gcc, tar, bash, etc.)
This overrides that protection.

Dont remove dependency information, do not use this unless you know exactly
