.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I scribbler
is part of the
.SM sorcery
source-code package management suite. Scribbler is a utility for controlling the
spells in your private grimoire. 
.SH "NOTE"
The 'to-grimoire' option is not used for the remove command.  If 'to-section'
is not specified, then the spell will be placed in a section named the same as
the one it came from. If the to-grimoire grimoire doesn't exist, scribbler will
offer to create it. This can also be achieved manually by using the add-grimoire
subcommand.
