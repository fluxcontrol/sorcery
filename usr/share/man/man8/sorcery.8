.TH SORCERY "8" "November 2004" "Source Mage GNU Linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
sorcery, xsorcery \- menu-driven software package management utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I sorcery [action]
.SH EXAMPLE
To get your system up to date, type
.I sorcery
system-update
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I sorcery
is an easy-to-use menu-driven (dialog-based) interface to the
.I sorcery
source-based package management system.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that all calls to sorcery with options are
semi-interactive (prompts time out) or non-interactive,
so they can be run from a cron script or something similar.
.PP
Only
.I sorcery
without options will start the menu-driven package management utility.
.SS -u|update
Updates the sorcery scripts
.B only.
This option is non-interactive and does not start up the  menu-driven interface. It is suitable for use in cron jobs.
.SS -s|system-update
Perform a system update (updates sorcery, grimoire, and spells).
[ sorcery update, scribe update, sorcery queue, cast --queue ]
.SS -g|upgrade
Update spells without first updating the grimoire.
[ sorcery queue, cast --queue ]
.SS -q|queue
Compare installed grimoire to installed spells, generate queue of spells needing to be updated.
.SS queue-security
Queue spells that had updates due to security fixes.
.SS -Z|queue-newer
Queue spells with newer versions only (i.e. no downgrades).
.SS -r|rebuild
Automatically rebuilds all installed software packages. This option
is non-interactive except for a bunch of config and depends questions the first
time you run it.
.SS -rr|rebuild-reconfigure
Automatically rebuilds all installed software packages. Unlike -r, this option
makes cast reask all the questions unconditionally.
.SS hold <spell|s>
sets <spell|s> to held.
This means that they stay installed, but that cast will refuse to
cast them. This will prevent them from being updated or changed at all.
This might be helpful if you change kernel versions
and the package won't build right on the new system, but still install (wrong).
.SS unhold <spell|s>
unholds <spell|s>, changes their status from held back to installed.
.SS exile <spell|s>
sets <spell|s> to exiled.
This means that they won't be installed in any way, sorcery just ignores them.
.SS unexile <spell|s>
removes exiled status from <spell|s>.
This means that they can be installed again.
.SS add-queue <spell|s>
Add spell(s) to install queue
.SS remove-queue <spell|s>
Remove spell(s) from install queue
.SS default <action> <on> <what> on|off
This is a sorcery feature to pre-answer some
depends questions. They will still be asked,
but they will default to what you set this to.
.PP
Generally, <on> is what spell will be used.
<what> can be a spell, in that case on or off is the default
answer to the "optionally depends on" question.
.P
<what> can also be a feature name.
All spells will default to use <on> as the provider for that then.
If it is an optional depends, they will use nothing if set to off,
and the provider if set to on.
.SS default add <on>|"" <what>|"" on|off
This adds a default statement to the list.
Either <on> or <what> (not both) can be "", in which case they work as
wildcards (anything <what> depends on / anything that depends on <on>)
.PP
.I Examples:
.TP
default add spell_1 spell_2 off
If "spell_1" optionally depends on "spell_2" the default answer is off.

.TP
default add "" spell on
If anything optionally depends on "spell" the default answer is on.

.TP
default add spell "" off
If "spell" optionally depends on anything the default answer is off.

.TP
default add spell PROVIDER on
"Spell" is the default provider for PROVIDER. In the case of optional_depends
and the value of "off", "none" is chosen as the default instead.

.SS default remove|search [<on>|"" [<what>|"" [on|off]]]
These are used to search or modify the defaults list.
Anything not specified or blank will be a wildcard.
Everything that matches will be removed/shown.
.PP
.I Examples:
.TP
default remove spell_1 spell_2
The default answer for when "spell_1" optionally depends on "spell_2" is removed.

.TP
default search spell PROVIDER off
Search the defaults to see if "spell" is not the default provider of PROVIDER.
